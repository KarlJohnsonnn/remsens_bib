  abstract  = {Two versions of the portable aerosol Raman lidar system (Polly) are presented. First, the two-channel prototype is depicted. It has been developed for the independent and simultaneous determination of particle backscatter and extinction coefficient profiles at 532 nm. Second, the 3 + 2 Raman lidar PollyXT (3 + 2: three backscatter and two extinction coefficients), the second generation of Polly, is described. The extended capabilities of PollyXT are due to the simultaneous emission of light with three wavelengths, more laser power, a larger main receiver mirror, and seven receiver channels. These systems are completely remotely controlled and all measurements are performed automatically. The collected data are transferred to a home server via the Internet and are displayed on a Web page. This paper describes the details of the optical setup, the housekeeping of the systems, and the used data retrieval routines. A measurement example taken close to Manaus, Brazil, on 15 August 2008 shows the capabilities of PollyXT.},

  abstract  = {Purpose of Review We assess the current understanding of the state and behaviour of aerosols under pre-industrial conditions and the importance for climate. Recent Findings Studies show that the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial period calculated by climate models is strongly affected by the abundance and properties of aerosols in the pre-industrial atmosphere. The low concentration of aerosol particles under relatively pristine conditions means that global mean cloud albedo may have been twice as sensitive to changes in natural aerosol emissions under pre-industrial conditions compared to present-day conditions. Consequently, the discovery of new aerosol formation processes and revisions to aerosol emissions have large effects on simulated historical aerosol radiative forcing. Summary We review what is known about the microphysical, chemical, and radiative properties of aerosols in the pre-industrial atmosphere and the processes that control them. Aerosol properties were controlled by a combination of natural emissions, modification of the natural emissions by human activities such as land-use change, and anthropogenic emissions from biofuel combustion and early industrial processes. Although aerosol concentrations were lower in the pre-industrial atmosphere than today, model simulations show that relatively high aerosol concentrations could have been maintained over continental regions due to biogenically controlled new particle formation and wildfires. Despite the importance of pre-industrial aerosols for historical climate change, the relevant processes and emissions are given relatively little consideration in climate models, and there have been very few attempts to evaluate them. Consequently, we have very low confidence in the ability of models to simulate the aerosol conditions that form the baseline for historical climate simulations. Nevertheless, it is clear that the 1850s should be regarded as an early industrial reference period, and the aerosol forcing calculated from this period is smaller than the forcing since 1750. Improvements in historical reconstructions of natural and early anthropogenic emissions, exploitation of new Earth system models, and a deeper understanding and evaluation of the controlling processes are key aspects to reducing uncertainties in future.},

The simultaneous observation of a microwave radiometer and a Raman lidar allowed an operational and continuous measurement of water vapour profiles also during cloudy conditions. The calibration method provides results which are in a good agreement with conventional methods based on radiosondes. The calibration factor derived from the proposed IWV method is very stable with a relative uncertainty of 5 \%. This stability allows for the calibration of the lidar even in the presence of clouds using the calibration factor determined during the most recent clear sky interval. Based on the application of this approach, it is possible to retrieve water vapour profiles during all non-precipitating conditions. A statistical analysis shows a good agreement between the lidar measurements and collocated radiosondes. The relative biases amount to less than 6.7 \% below 2 km.},

	abstract = "In this work, a two-step algorithm to obtain water vapour profiles from a combination of Raman lidar and microwave radiometer is presented. Both instruments were applied during an intensive 2-month measurement campaign (HOPE) close to J{\"u}lich, western Germany, during spring 2013. To retrieve reliable water vapour information from inside or above the cloud a two-step algorithm is applied. The first step is a Kalman filter that extends the profiles, truncated at cloud base, to the full height range (up to 10 km) by combining previous information and current measurement. Then the complete water vapour profile serves as input to the one-dimensional variational (1D-VAR) method, also known as optimal estimation. A forward model simulates the brightness temperatures which would be observed by the microwave radiometer for the given atmospheric state. The profile is iteratively modified according to its error bars until the modelled and the actually measured brightness temperatures sufficiently agree. The functionality of the retrieval is presented in detail by means of case studies under different conditions. A statistical analysis shows that the availability of Raman lidar data (night) improves the accuracy of the profiles even under cloudy conditions. During the day, the absence of lidar data results in larger differences in comparison to reference radiosondes. The data availability of the full-height water vapour lidar profiles of 17 \% during the 2-month campaign is significantly enhanced to 60 \% by applying the retrieval. The bias with respect to radiosonde and the retrieved a posteriori uncertainty of the retrieved profiles clearly show that the application of the Kalman filter considerably improves the accuracy and quality of the retrieved mixing ratio profiles.",

  abstract  = {During the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) project, the microphysical properties of over 1000 warm, nonprecipitating, clouds were measured from the University of Washington research aircraft. The clouds were partially embedded in the continental-scale, smoky haze that envelops much of Brazil during the biomass-burning season. For the entire data set, the most universal parameterization for the effective cloud droplet radius (r(eff)) is as a function of the ratio of cloud liquid water content (LWC) to droplet concentration (essentially the volume mean radius, r(v)); this agrees with previous studies under less polluted conditions. Comparisons of SCAR-B data with data from the east coast of the United States and clean oceanic areas show that the r(eff)-r(v) relationship is similar in all three cases, suggesting that even the extreme case of clouds impacted by large biomass fires can be treated similarly to more typical clouds. Beyond a certain ambient concentration of accumulation-mode particles (similar to 3000-4000 cm(-3)), cloud drop number concentrations for cumulus clouds in Brazil were almost constant, so that further increases in the ambient particle concentration did not change r(eff), and r(eff) correlates well with LWC alone. For example, a cumulus cloud, which capped a particularly large smoke plume with total particle concentrations >150,000 cm(-3), had the same r(eff)-LWC relationship as other clouds in the region where the ambient particle concentrations were similar to 3000 cm(-3). In this study the values of r(eff) for cumulus clouds in Brazil affected by smoke were between 3 and 8 mu m, compared to 9 to 14 mu m inferred from satellite measurements of cloud reflectivity at 3.7 mu m by Kaufman and Fraser [1997].},

Comparisons with the aircraft measurements are made for 16 overpasses through thin cloud layers within a 1.5-km radius of the remote sensor site. Over a range of liquid-water contents from 0.04 to 0.57 g m -3 the mean difference between the aircraft and the radar/radiometer values was 0.02 g m -3, and the maximum difference was 0.09 g m -3. Although the number of comparisons is limited, these results suggest that the ground-based estimates may be sufficiently accurate for many scientific purposes.},

  abstract  = {The cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) is of central interest to improve the understanding of cloud physics and for quantifying the effective radiative forcing by aerosol-cloud interactions. Current standard satellite retrievals do not operationally provide Nd, but it can be inferred from retrievals of cloud optical depth (c) cloud droplet effective radius (re) and cloud top temperature. This review summarizes issues with this approach and quantifies uncertainties. A total relative uncertainty of 78\% is inferred for pixel-level retrievals for relatively homogeneous, optically thick and unobscured stratiform clouds with favorable viewing geometry. The uncertainty is even greater if these conditions are not met. For averages over 1∘ ×1∘ regions the uncertainty is reduced to 54\% assuming random errors for instrument uncertainties. In contrast, the few evaluation studies against reference in situ observations suggest much better accuracy with little variability in the bias. More such studies are required for a better error characterization. Nd uncertainty is dominated by errors in re, and therefore, improvements in re retrievals would greatly improve the quality of the Nd retrievals. Recommendations are made for how this might be achieved. Some existing Nd data sets are compared and discussed, and best practices for the use of Nd data from current passive instruments (e.g., filtering criteria) are recommended. Emerging alternative Nd estimates are also considered. First, new ideas to use additional information from existing and upcoming spaceborne instruments are discussed, and second, approaches using high-quality ground-based observations are examined.�},

Dynamical properties of ice clouds can be determined via Doppler measurements from ground-based, profiling cloud radars. Here, the decomposition of the Doppler velocities into reflectivity-weighted particle velocity Vt and vertical air motion w is described. The methodology is applied to high clouds observations from 35-GHz profiling millimeter wavelength radars at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) climate research facility in Oklahoma (January 1997--December 2010) and the ARM Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) site in Manus (July 1999--December 2010). The Doppler velocity measurements are used to detect gravity waves (GW), whose correlation with high cloud macrophysical properties is investigated. Cloud turbulence is studied in the absence and presence of GW. High clouds are less turbulent when GW are observed. Probability density functions of Vt, w, and high cloud macrophysical properties for the two cloud subsets (with and without GW) are presented. Air-density-corrected Vt for high clouds for which GW (no GW) were detected amounted to hourly means and standard deviations of 0.89 ± 0.52 m s−1 (0.8 ± 0.48 m s−1) and 1.03 ± 0.41 m s−1 (0.86 ± 0.49 m s−1) at SGP and Manus, respectively. The error of w at one standard deviation was estimated as 0.15 m s−1. Hourly means of w averaged around 0 m s−1 with standard deviations of ±0.27 (SGP) and ±0.29 m s−1 (Manus) for high clouds without GW and ±0.22 m s−1 (both sites) for high clouds with GW. The midlatitude site showed stronger seasonality in detected high cloud properties.},

By removing the vertical air motion from Vd, the power law can be rewritten as Vt = aZb with Vt being the reflectivity‐weighted particle terminal fall velocity. Profiles of this relation are variable with height. An attempt was made to relate this variability to the dominant microphysical processes in different layers of the cloud. Based on that, the possibility of using profiles of the parameters a and b to distinguish different microphysical regimes was explored. The methodology was applied to long‐term measurements (January 1997 to December 2010) at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site in the Southern Great Plains. Principal component analysis was used to determine the modes of the profiles that explain most of the observed variance in the observations. Profile‐averaged means and standard deviations of parameters a and b amounted to 0.65 ± 0.42 and 0.03 ± 0.19, respectively. Furthermore, three commonly used microphysical relations related to bulk quantities were used to determine values of a and b. These results were found to compare reasonably well with the values obtained from the radar observations. Finally, microphysical considerations showed that radar‐derived values of parameter b can be explained in terms of particle size distribution moment changes.},

The presented analysis of the height evolution of the radar Doppler spectra is a state-of-the-art retrieval with profiling cloud radars in SLW layers beyond the traditional use of spectral moments. Dynamical effects are considered by following the particle population evolution along slanted tracks that are caused by horizontal advection of the cloud under wind shear conditions. In the SLW layer, the identified liquid peak is used as an air motion tracer to correct the Doppler spectra for vertical air motion and the ice peak is used to study the radar profiles of rimed particles. A 1-D steady-state bin microphysical model is constrained using the SLW and air motion profiles and cloud top radar observations. The observed radar moment profiles of the rimed snow can be simulated reasonably well by the model, but not without making several assumptions about the ice particle concentration and the relative role of deposition and aggregation. This suggests that in situ observations of key ice properties are needed to complement the profiling radar observations before process-oriented studies can effectively evaluate ice microphysical parameterizations.},

Results from experiments in the eastern Pacific, South Atlantic, subtropical regions of the North Atlantic, and the sea areas around the British Isles are presented. In situations where entrainment effects are small the (effective radius)3 is found to be a linear function of the (volume-averaged radius)3 in a given cloud and can thus be parameterized with respect to the liquid water content and the droplet number concentration in the cloud. However, the shape of the droplet size spectrum is very dependent on the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) characteristics below cloud base, and the relationship between effective radius and volume-averaged radius varies between maritime air masses and continental air masses. This study also details comparisons that have been made in stratocumulus between the droplet number concentrations and (a) aerosol concentrations below cloud base in the size range 0.1 to 3.0 μm and (b) CCN supersaturation spectra in the boundary layer. A parameterization relating droplet concentration and aerosol concentration is suggested. The effects of nonadiabatic processes on the parameterization of effective radius are discussed. Drizzle is found to have little effect near cloud top, but in precipitating stratocumulus clouds the parameterization breaks down near cloud base. Comparisons are made between this parameterization of effective radius and others used currently or in the past.},

  abstract  = {Cloud properties from both ground-based as well as from geostationary passive satellite observations have been used previously for diagnosing aerosol--cloud interactions. In this investigation, a 2-year data set together with four selected case studies are analyzed with the aim of evaluating the consistency and limitations of current ground-based and satellite-retrieved cloud property data sets. The typically applied adiabatic cloud profile is modified using a sub-adiabatic factor to account for entrainment within the cloud. Based on the adiabatic factor obtained from the combination of ground-based cloud radar, ceilometer and microwave radiometer, we demonstrate that neither the assumption of a completely adiabatic cloud nor the assumption of a constant sub-adiabatic factor is fulfilled (mean adiabatic factor 0.63±0.22). As cloud adiabaticity is required to estimate the cloud droplet number concentration but is not available from passive satellite observations, an independent method to estimate the adiabatic factor, and thus the influence of mixing, would be highly desirable for global-scale analyses. Considering the radiative effect of a cloud described by the sub-adiabatic model, we focus on cloud optical depth and its sensitivities. Ground-based estimates are here compared vs. cloud optical depth retrieved from the Meteosat SEVIRI satellite instrument resulting in a bias of −4 and a root mean square difference of 16. While a synergistic approach based on the combination of ceilometer, cloud radar and microwave radiometer enables an estimate of the cloud droplet concentration, it is highly sensitive to radar calibration and to assumptions about the moments of the droplet size distribution. Similarly, satellite-based estimates of cloud droplet concentration are uncertain. We conclude that neither the ground-based nor satellite-based cloud retrievals applied here allow a robust estimate of cloud droplet concentration, which complicates its use for the study of aerosol--cloud interactions.},

This expression depends upon the cloud droplet concentration, the liquid water path and a parameter A that relates linearly the liquid water content to the distance above cloud base. Secondly, an analytic expression of the adiabatic liquid water content is derived and reveals that A depends exclusively upon the cloud base characteristics. By using climatological cloud base values to determine the A value as well as two ``standard'' droplet concentrations representing respectively droplet concentrations in maritime and continental clouds, one obtains parameterized expressions of the droplet effective radius that depend exclusively upon the liquid water path. The maritime parameterization is validated by using observational data.},

The climatology provides monthly mean 1×1° CDNC values plus associated uncertainties over the global ice-free oceans. All values are in-cloud values, i.e. the reported CDNC value will be valid for the cloudy part of the grid box. Here, we provide an overview of how the climatology was generated and assess and quantify potential systematic error sources including effects of broken clouds, and remaining artefacts caused by the retrieval process or related to observation geometry. Retrievals and evaluations were performed at the scale of initial MODIS observations (in contrast to some earlier climatologies, which were created based on already gridded data). This allowed us to implement additional screening criteria, so that observations inconsistent with key assumptions made in the CDNC retrieval could be rejected. Application of these additional screening criteria led to significant changes in the annual cycle of CDNC in terms of both its phase and magnitude. After an optimal screening was established a final CDNC climatology was generated. Resulting CDNC uncertainties are reported as monthly-mean standard deviations of CDNC over each 1×1° grid box. These uncertainties are of the order of 30\% in the stratocumulus regions and 60 to 80\% elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Abstract The plane-parallel model for the parameterization of clouds in global climate models is examined in order to estimate the effects of the vertical profile of the microphysical parameters on radiative transfer calculations for extended boundary layer clouds. The vertically uniform model is thus compared to the adiabatic stratified one. The validation of the adiabatic model is based on simultaneous measurements of cloud microphysical parameters in situ and cloud radiative properties from above the cloud layer with a multispectral radiometer. In particular, the observations demonstrate that the dependency of cloud optical thickness on cloud geometrical thickness is larger than predicted with the vertically uniform model and that it is in agreement with the prediction of the adiabatic one. Numerical simulations of the radiative transfer have been performed to establish the equivalence between the two models in terms of the effective radius. They show that the equivalent effective radius of a vertically uniform model is between 80\% and 100\% of the effective radius at the top of an adiabatic stratified model. The relationship depends, in fact, upon the cloud geometrical thickness and droplet concentration. Remote sensing measurements of cloud radiances in the visible and near infrared are then examined at the scale of a cloud system for a marine case and the most polluted case sampled during the second Aerosol Characterization Experiment. The distributions of the measured values are significantly different between the two cases. This constitutes observational evidence of the aerosol indirect effect at the scale of a cloud system. Finally, the adiabatic stratified model is used to develop a procedure for the retrieval of cloud geometrical thickness and cloud droplet number concentration from the measurements of cloud radiances. It is applied to the marine and to the polluted cases. The retrieved values of droplet concentration are significantly underestimated with respect to the values measured in situ. Despite this discrepancy the procedure is efficient at distinguishing the difference between the two cases.},

Satellite sources include SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, WindSat, SSMIS, AMSR-2, and GMI. To mitigate spurious CLWP trends, the climatology is corrected for drifting satellite overpass times by simultaneously solving for the monthly average CLWP and the monthly mean diurnal cycle. In addition to a longer record and six additional satellite products, major enhancements relative to the UWisc climatology include updating the input to version 7 RSS retrievals, correcting for a CLWP bias (based on matchups to clear-sky MODIS scenes), and constructing a total (cloud + rain) liquid water path (TLWP) record for use in analyses of columnar liquid water in raining clouds. Because the microwave emission signal from cloud water is similar to that of precipitation-sized hydrometeors, greater uncertainty in the CLWP record is expected in regions of substantial precipitation. Therefore, the TLWP field can also be used as a quality-control screen, where uncertainty increases as the ratio of CLWP to TLWP decreases. For regions where confidence in CLWP is highest (i.e., CLWP:TLWP > 0.8), systematic differences in MAC CLWP relative to UWisc CLWP range from −15\% (e.g., global oceanic stratocumulus decks) to +5\%--10\% (e.g., portions of the higher latitudes, storm tracks, and shallower convection regions straddling the ITCZ).

  abstract  = {Cloud Doppler radars are increasingly used to study cloud and precipitation microphysical processes. Typical bulk cloud properties such as liquid or ice content are usually derived using the first three standard moments of the radar Doppler spectrum. Recent studies demonstrated the value of higher moments for the reduction of retrieval uncertainties and for providing additional insights into microphysical processes. Large effort has been undertaken, e.g., within the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program to ensure high quality of radar Doppler spectra. However, a systematic approach concerning the accuracy of higher moment estimates and sensitivity to basic radar system settings, such as spectral resolution, integration time and beam width, are still missing. In this study, we present an approach on how to optimize radar settings for radar Doppler spectra moments in the specific context of drizzle detection. The process of drizzle development has shown to be particularly sensitive to higher radar moments such as skewness. We collected radar raw data (I/Q time series) from consecutive zenith-pointing observations for two liquid cloud cases observed at the cloud observatory JOYCE in Germany. The I/Q data allowed us to process Doppler spectra and derive their moments using different spectral resolutions and integration times during identical time intervals. This enabled us to study the sensitivity of the spatiotemporal structure of the derived moments to the different radar settings. The observed signatures were further investigated using a radar Doppler forward model which allowed us to compare observed and simulated sensitivities and also to study the impact of additional hardware-dependent parameters such as antenna beam width. For the observed cloud with drizzle onset we found that longer integration times mainly modify spectral width (S$_w$) and skewness (S$_k$), leaving other moments mostly unaffected. An integration time of 2s seems to be an optimal compromise: both observations and simulations revealed that a 10s integration time -- as it is widely used for European cloud radars -- leads to a significant turbulence-induced increase of S$_w$ and reduction of S$_k$ compared to 2~s integration time. This can lead to significantly different microphysical interpretations with respect to drizzle water content and effective radius. A change from 2s to even shorter integration times (0. 4s) has much smaller effects on S$_w$ and S$_k$. We also find that spectral resolution has a small impact on the moment estimations, and thus on the microphysical interpretation of the drizzle signal. Even the coarsest spectral resolution studied, 0. 08ms$^{-1}$, seems to be appropriate for calculation moments of drizzling clouds. Moreover, simulations provided additional insight into the microphysical interpretation of the skewness signatures observed: in low (high)-turbulence conditions, only drizzle larger than 20~$\mu$m (40~$\mu$m) can generate S$_k$ values above the S$_k$ noise level (in our case 0.4). Higher S$_k$ values are also obtained in simulations when smaller beam widths are adopted.},

  abstract  = {Polarimetric radar-based hydrometeor classification is the procedure of identifying different types of hydrometeors by exploiting polarimetric radar observations. The main drawback of the existing supervised classification methods, mostly based on fuzzy logic, is a significant dependency on a presumed electromagnetic behaviour of different hydrometeor types. Namely, the results of the classification largely rely upon the quality of scattering simulations. When it comes to the unsupervised approach, it lacks the constraints related to the hydrometeor microphysics. The idea of the proposed method is to compensate for these drawbacks by combining the two approaches in a way that microphysical hypotheses can, to a degree, adjust the content of the classes obtained statistically from the observations. This is done by means of an iterative approach, performed offline, which, in a statistical framework, examines clustered representative polarimetric observations by comparing them to the presumed polarimetric properties of each hydrometeor class. Aside from comparing, a routine alters the content of clusters by encouraging further statistical clustering in case of non-identification. By merging all identified clusters, the multi-dimensional polarimetric signatures of various hydrometeor types are obtained for each of the studied representative datasets, i.e. for each radar system of interest. These are depicted by sets of centroids which are then employed in operational labelling of different hydrometeors. The method has been applied on three C-band datasets, each acquired by different operational radar from the MeteoSwiss Rad4Alp network, as well as on two X-band datasets acquired by two research mobile radars. The results are discussed through a comparative analysis which includes a corresponding supervised and unsupervised approach, emphasising the operational potential of the proposed method.},

Until recently, no in situ observations have been available to investigate links between microphysical snowfall properties and their scattering properties. In this study, we investigate for the first time relations between collocated ground‐based triple‐frequency observations with in situ measurements of snowfall at the ground. The three analyzed snowfall cases obtained during a recent field campaign in Finland cover light to moderate snowfall rates with transitions from heavily rimed snow to open‐structured, low‐density snowflakes. The observed triple‐frequency signatures agree well with the previously published findings from airborne radar observations. A rich spatiotemporal structure of triple‐frequency observations throughout the cloud is observed during the three cases, which often seems to be related to riming and aggregation zones within the cloud. The comparison of triple‐frequency signatures from the lowest altitudes with the ground‐based in situ measurements reveals that in the presence of large (>5 mm) snow aggregates, a bending away in the triple‐frequency space from the curve of classical spheroid scattering models is always observed. Rimed particles appear along an almost horizontal line in the triple‐frequency space, which was not observed before. Overall, the three case studies indicate a close connection of triple‐frequency signatures and snow particle structure, bulk snowfall density, and characteristic size of the particle size distribution.},

  abstract  = {The U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program operates millimeter-wavelength cloud radars in several climatologically distinct regions. The digital signal processors for these radars were recently upgraded and allow for enhancements in the operational parameters running on them. Recent evaluations of millimeter-wavelength cloud radar signal processing performance relative to the range of cloud dynamical and microphysical conditions encountered at the ARM Program sites have indicated that improvements are necessary, including significant improvement in temporal resolution (i.e., less than 1 s for dwell and 2 s for dwell and processing), wider Nyquist velocities, operational dealiasing of the recorded spectra, removal of pulse compression while sampling the boundary layer, and continuous recording of Doppler spectra. A new set of millimeter-wavelength cloud radar operational modes that incorporate these enhancements is presented. A significant change in radar sampling is the introduction of an uneven mode sequence with 50\% of the sampling time dedicated to the lower atmosphere, allowing for detailed characterization of boundary layer clouds. The changes in the operational modes have a substantial impact on the postprocessing algorithms that are used to extract cloud information from the radar data. New methods for postprocessing of recorded Doppler spectra are presented that result in more accurate identification of radar clutter (e.g., insects) and extraction of turbulence and microphysical information. Results of recent studies on the error characteristics of derived Doppler moments are included so that uncertainty estimates are now included with the moments. The microscale data product based on the increased temporal resolution of the millimeter-wavelength cloud radars is described. It contains the number of local maxima in each Doppler spectrum, the Doppler moments of the primary peak, uncertainty estimates for the Doppler moments of the primary peak, Doppler moment shape parameters (e.g., skewness and kurtosis), and clear-air clutter flags.},

Here, the first generation of sampling strategies for the scanning ARM cloud radars (SACRs) is presented. These scan strategies are designed to address the scientific objectives of ARM; however, they introduce an initial framework for operational scanning cloud radars. While the weather community uses scan strategies that are based on a sequence of scans at constant elevations, the SACR scan strategies are based on a sequence of scans at constant azimuth. This is attributed to the cloud geometrical properties, which are vastly different from the rain and snow shafts that are the primary targets of precipitation radars; the need to cover the cone of silence; and the scanning limitations of the SACRs. A ``cloud surveillance'' scan strategy is introduced that is based on a sequence of horizon-to-horizon range--height indicator (RHI) scans that sample the hemispherical sky (HS) every 30° azimuth (HSRHI). The HSRHI scan strategy is complimented with a low-elevation plan position indicator (PPI) scan. The HSRHI and PPI are repeated every 30 min to provide a static view of the cloud conditions around the SACR location. Between the HSRHI and PPI scan strategies, other scan strategies are introduced depending on the cloud conditions. In the future, information about the atmospheric cloud state will be used in a closed-loop process to optimize the selection of the SACR scan strategy.},

In this study, the phase partitioning of cloud water is compared among six global climate models (GCMs) and with Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization retrievals. It is found that the GCMs predict vastly different distributions of cloud phase for a given temperature, and none of them are capable of reproducing the spatial distribution or magnitude of the observed phase partitioning. While some GCMs produced liquid water paths comparable to satellite observations, they all failed to preserve sufficient liquid water at mixed‐phase cloud temperatures. Our results suggest that validating GCMs using only the vertically integrated water contents could lead to amplified differences in cloud radiative feedback. The sensitivity of the simulated cloud phase in GCMs to the choice of heterogeneous ice nucleation parameterization is also investigated. The response to a change in ice nucleation is quite different for each GCM, and the implementation of the same ice nucleation parameterization in all models does not reduce the spread in simulated phase among GCMs. The results suggest that processes subsequent to ice nucleation are at least as important in determining phase and should be the focus of future studies aimed at understanding and reducing differences among the models.},

The MMCRs, which are centerpiece instruments for the observation of clouds and precipitation, provide continuous, vertically resolved information on all hydrometeors above the ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF). However, their ability to observe clouds in the lowest 2--3 km of the atmosphere is often obscured by the presence of strong echoes from insects, especially during the warm months at the continental midlatitude Southern Great Plains (SGP) ACRF. Here, a new automated technique for the detection and elimination of insect-contaminated echoes from the MMCR observations is presented. The technique is based on recorded MMCR Doppler spectra, a feature extractor that conditions insect spectral signatures, and the use of a neural network algorithm for the generation of an insect (clutter) mask. The technique exhibits significant skill in the identification of insect radar returns (more than 92\% of insect-induced returns are identified) when the sole input to the classifier is the MMCR Doppler spectrum. The addition of circular polarization observations by the MMCR and ceilometer cloud-base measurements further improve the performance of the technique and form an even more reliable method for the removal of insect radar echoes at the ARM site. Recently, a 94-GHz Doppler polarimetric radar was installed next to the MMCR at the ACRF SGP site. Observations by both radars are used to evaluate the potential of the 94-GHz radar as being insect free and to show that dual wavelength radar reflectivity measurements can be used to identify insect radar returns.},

  abstract  = {The retrieval of cloud, drizzle, and turbulence parameters using radar Doppler spectra is challenged by the convolution of microphysical and dynamical influences and the overall uncertainty introduced by turbulence. A new technique that utilizes recorded radar Doppler spectra from profiling cloud radars is presented here. The technique applies to areas in clouds where drizzle is initially produced by the autoconversion process and is detected by a positive skewness in the radar Doppler spectrum. Using the Gaussian-shape property of cloud Doppler spectra, the cloud-only radar Doppler spectrum is estimated and used to separate the cloud and drizzle contributions. Once separated, the cloud spectral peak can be used to retrieve vertical air motion and eddy dissipation rates, while the drizzle peak can be used to estimate the three radar moments of the drizzle particle size distribution. The technique works for nearly 50\% of spectra found near cloud top, with efficacy diminishing to roughly 15\% of spectra near cloud base. The approach has been tested on a large dataset collected in the Azores during the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Mobile Facility deployment on Graciosa Island from May 2009 through December 2010. Validation of the proposed technique is achieved using the cloud base as a natural boundary between radar Doppler spectra with and without cloud droplets. The retrieval algorithm has the potential to characterize the dynamical and microphysical conditions at cloud scale during the transition from cloud to precipitation. This has significant implications for improving the understanding of drizzle onset in liquid clouds and for improving model parameterization schemes of autoconversion of cloud water into drizzle.},

The MRR is a low-cost, portable radar system that requires minimum supervision in the field. As such, the MRR is a frequently used radar system for conducting precipitation research. Current MRR drawbacks are the lack of a sophisticated post-processing algorithm to improve its sensitivity (currently at +3 dBz), spurious artefacts concerning radar receiver noise and the lack of high quality Doppler radar moments. Here we propose an improved processing method which is especially suited for snow observations and provides reliable values of effective reflectivity, Doppler velocity and spectral width. The proposed method is freely available on the web and features a noise removal based on recognition of the most significant peak. A dynamic dealiasing routine allows observations even if the Nyquist velocity range is exceeded. Collocated observations over 115 days of a MRR and a pulsed 35.2 GHz MIRA35 cloud radar show a very high agreement for the proposed method for snow, if reflectivities are larger than −5 dBz. The overall sensitivity is increased to −14 and −8 dBz, depending on range. The proposed method exploits the full potential of MRR's hardware and substantially enhances the use of Micro Rain Radar for studies of solid precipitation.},

  abstract  = {The study of Arctic ice and mixed‐phase clouds, which are characterized by a variety of ice particle types in the same cloudy volume, is challenging research. This study illustrates a new approach to qualitative and quantitative analysis of the complexity of ice and mixed‐phase microphysical processes in Arctic deep precipitating systems using the combination of Ka‐band zenith‐pointing radar Doppler spectra and quasi‐vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables measured by a Ka/W‐band scanning radar. The results illustrate the frequent occurrence of multimodal Doppler spectra in the dendritic/planar growth layer, where locally generated, slower‐falling particle populations are well separated from faster‐falling populations in terms of Doppler velocity. The slower‐falling particle populations contribute to an increase of differential reflectivity (ZDR), while an enhanced specific differential phase (KDP) in this dendritic growth temperature range is caused by both the slower and faster‐falling particle populations. Another area with frequent occurrence of multimodal Doppler spectra is in mixed‐phase layers, where both populations produce ZDR and KDP values close to 0, suggesting the occurrence of a riming process. Joint analysis of the Doppler spectra and the polarimetric radar variables provides important insight into the microphysics of snow formation and allows the separation of the contributions of ice of different habits to the values of reflectivity and ZDR.},

Combining vertical profiles from AMF2 with surface-based in situ SMEAR II observations allows the processes at the surface to be directly related to processes occurring throughout the entire tropospheric column. Together with the inclusion of extensive surface precipitation measurements and intensive observation periods involving aircraft flights and novel radiosonde launches, the complementary observations provide a unique opportunity for investigating aerosol--cloud interactions and cloud-to-precipitation processes in a boreal environment. The BAECC dataset provides opportunities for evaluating and improving models of aerosol sources and transport, cloud microphysical processes, and boundary layer structures.

  abstract  = {A new method to automatically classify solid hydrometeors based on Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) images is presented. For each individual image, the method relies on the calculation of a set of geometric and texture-based descriptors to simultaneously identify the hydrometeor type (among six predefined classes), estimate the degree of riming and detect melting snow. The classification tasks are achieved by means of a regularized multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model trained over more than 3000 MASC images manually labeled by visual inspection. In a second step, the probabilistic information provided by the MLR is weighed on the three stereoscopic views of the MASC in order to assign a unique label to each hydrometeor. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on data collected in the Swiss Alps and in Antarctica. The algorithm achieves high performance, with a hydrometeor-type classification accuracy and Heidke skill score of 95\% and 0.93, respectively. The degree of riming is evaluated by introducing a riming index ranging between zero (no riming) and one (graupel) and characterized by a probable error of 5.5\%. A validation study is conducted through a comparison with an existing classification method based on two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD) data and shows that the two methods are consistent.},

  abstract  = {Knowledge of cloud phase (liquid, ice, mixed, etc.) is necessary to describe the radiative impact of clouds and their lifetimes, but is a property that is difficult to simulate correctly in climate models. One step towards improving those simulations is to make observations of cloud phase with sufficient accuracy to help constrain model representations of cloud processes. In this study, we outline a methodology using a basic Bayesian classifier to estimate the probabilities of cloud-phase class from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) vertically pointing active remote sensors. The advantage of this method over previous ones is that it provides uncertainty information on the phase classification. We also test the value of including higher moments of the cloud radar Doppler spectrum than are traditionally used operationally. Using training data of known phase from the Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (M-PACE) field campaign, we demonstrate a proof of concept for how the method can be used to train an algorithm that identifies ice, liquid, mixed phase, and snow. Over 95\% of data are identified correctly for pure ice and liquid cases used in this study. Mixed-phase and snow cases are more problematic to identify correctly. When lidar data are not available, including additional information from the Doppler spectrum provides substantial improvement to the algorithm. This is a first step towards an operational algorithm and can be expanded to include additional categories such as drizzle with additional training data.},

  abstract  = {In certain circumstances, millimeter-wavelength Doppler radar velocity spectra can be used to estimate the microphysical composition of both phases of mixed-phase clouds. This distinction is possible when the cloud properties are such that they produce a bimodal Doppler velocity spectrum. Under these conditions, the Doppler spectrum moments of the distinct liquid and ice spectral modes may be computed independently and used to quantitatively derive properties of the liquid droplet and ice particle size distributions. Additionally, the cloud liquid spectral mode, which is a tracer for clear-air motions, can be used to estimate the vertical air motion and to correct estimates of ice particle fall speeds. A mixed-phase cloud case study from the NASA Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cloud Layers- Florida Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL-FACE) is used to illustrate this new retrieval approach. The case of interest occurred on 29 July 2002 when a supercooled liquid cloud layer based at 5 km AGL and precipitating ice crystals advected over a ground measurement site. Ground-based measurements from both 35- and 94-GHz radars revealed clear bimodal Doppler velocity spectra within this cloud layer. Profiles of radar reflectivity were computed independently from the liquid and ice spectral modes of the velocity spectra. Empirical reflectivity- based relationships were then used to derive profiles of both liquid and ice microphysical parameters, such as water content and particle size. Although the ice crystals extended down to a height of 4 km, the radar measurements were able to distinguish the base of the cloud liquid at 5 km, in good agreement with cloud-base measurements from a collocated micropulse lidar. Furthermore, radar-derived cloud liquid water paths were in good agreement with liquid water paths derived from a collocated microwave radiometer. Results presented here demonstrate the ability of the radar to both identify and quantify the presence of both phases in some mixed-phase clouds. They also demonstrate that, in terms of radar reflectivity, the ice component of mixed-phase clouds typically dominates the radar signal, while in terms of mean Doppler velocity, the liquid component can make a significant contribution. The high temporal resolution, 94-GHz Doppler radar observations were able to reveal a periodic cloud-top updraft that, combined with horizontal wind speeds, suggests a horizontal scale for the in-cloud circulations.},

The observations suggest that strong cloud top cooling was necessary to produce the well‐mixed cloud layers; clouds shielded from radiative cooling by overlaying clouds more frequently existed in absolutely stable layers. The in situ measurements revealed that most liquid layers contained drizzle, the production process of which was shown from the radar and lidar measurements to have been interrupted only during heavier ice‐precipitation events. Different layers interacted with one another by changing the radiative heating profile and by precipitation which changed the growth paths available to cloud particles and even initiated new hydrometeor classes.},

  abstract  = {This study presents and applies three separate processing methods to improve high-order moments estimated from 35GHz (Ka band) vertically pointing radar Doppler velocity spectra. The first processing method removes Doppler-shifted ground clutter from spectra collected by a US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program Ka-band zenith pointing radar (KAZR) deployed at Oliktok Point (OLI), Alaska. Ground clutter resulted from multiple pathways through antenna side lobes and reflections off a rotating scanning radar antenna located 2m away from KAZR, which caused Doppler shifts in ground clutter returns from stationary targets 2.5km away. After removing clutter in the recorded velocity spectra, the second processing method identifies multiple separate and sub-peaks in the spectra and estimates high-order moments for each peak. Multiple peaks and high-order moments were estimated for both original 2 and 15s averaged spectra. The third processing step improves the spectrum variance, skewness, and kurtosis estimates by removing velocity variability due to turbulent broadening during 15s averaging intervals. Applying the multiple peak processing to Doppler velocity spectra during liquid-only clouds can identify cloud and drizzle particles and during mixed-phase clouds can identify liquid cloud and frozen hydrometeors. Consistent with previous studies, this work found that spectrum skewness assuming only a single spectral peak was a good indicator of two hydrometeor populations (for example, cloud and drizzle particles) being present in the radar pulse volume. Yet, after dividing the spectrum into multiple peaks, velocity spectrum skewness for individual peaks is near zero, indicating nearly symmetric peaks. This suggests that future studies should use velocity skewness of single-peak spectra as an indicator of possible multiple hydrometeor populations and then use multiple-peak moments for quantitative studies. Three future activities will continue this work. First, KAZR spectra from several ARM sites have been processed and are available in the ARM archive as a principal investigator (PI) product. ARM programmers are evaluating these processing methods as part of future multiple-peak products generated by ARM. Third, MATLAB code generating the Oliktok Point products has been uploaded as supplemental material for public dissemination.},

In the models, the properties of clouds are simplified and expressed in terms of the fraction of the model grid box, which is filled with cloud, together with the liquid and ice water content of the clouds. These models must get the clouds right if they are to correctly represent both their radiative properties and their key role in the production of precipitation, but there are few observations of the vertical profiles of the cloud properties that show whether or not they are successful. Cloud profiles derived from cloud radars, ceilometers, and dual-frequency microwave radiometers operated at three sites in France, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom for several years have been compared with the clouds in seven European models. The advantage of this continuous appraisal is that the feedback on how new versions of models are performing is provided in quasi-real time, as opposed to the much longer time scale needed for in-depth analysis of complex field studies. Here, two occasions are identified when the introduction of new versions of the ECMWF and M{\'e}t{\'e}o-France models leads to an immediate improvement in the representation of the clouds and also provides statistics on the performance of the seven models.

In particular, there has been recent focus on improving representations of ice collection processes (e.g., aggregation and riming), as these influence precipitation rate, heating profiles, and ultimately cloud life cycles. However, distinguishing these processes using conventional polarimetric radar observations is difficult, as they produce similar fingerprints. This necessitates improved analysis techniques and integration of complementary data sources. The Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) provided such an opportunity. Quasi?vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables in two MC3E stratiform precipitation events reveal episodic melting layer sagging. Integrated analyses using scanning and vertically pointing radar and aircraft measurements reveal that saggy bright band signatures are produced when denser, faster?falling, more isometric hydrometeors (relative to adjacent times) descend into the melting layer. In one case, strong circumstantial evidence for riming is found during bright band sagging times. A bin microphysical melting layer model successfully reproduces many aspects of the signature, supporting the observational analysis. If found to be a reliable indicator of riming, saggy bright bands could be a proxy for the presence of supercooled liquid water in stratiform precipitation, which may provide important information for mitigating aircraft icing risks and for constraining microphysical models.},

Compared to dust-free air masses, a significantly higher amount of ice-containing clouds (25\%–30\% more) was observed for cloud top temperatures from −10°C to −20°C in air masses that contained mineral dust. The midlatitude lidar study is compared with our SAMUM lidar study of tropical stratiform clouds at Cape Verde in the winter of 2008. The comparison reveals that heterogeneous ice formation is much stronger over central Europe and starts at higher temperatures than over the tropical station.

Small but consistent differences in zenith Ka-band radar Doppler velocity and lidar depolarization measurements were found between aggregation- and riming-dominated periods.

Millimeter wavelength cloud radars (MMCR) are able to penetrate and detect multiple cloud layers. However, in mixed‐phase conditions, ice crystals dominate the radar signal, rendering the detection of liquid droplets from radar observables more difficult. The technique proposed here overcomes this fundamental limitation by using morphological features in MMCR Doppler spectra to detect supercooled liquid droplets in the radar sampling volume in the presence of ice particles. High lidar backscatter and near‐zero lidar depolarization measurements (good indicators of the presence of liquid droplets) from the Mixed‐Phase Arctic Clouds Experiment (MPACE) conducted in Barrow, Alaska, are used to train the technique and evaluate its potential for detecting mixed‐phase conditions. Ceilometer, microwave radiometer, and radiosonde measurements provide additional independent validation. Because of the ability of MMCRs to penetrate multiple liquid layers, this radar‐based technique does not suffer from the extinction limitations of lidars and is thus able to expand cloud phase identification methods to cloud regions beyond where lidars can penetrate, providing output at the native radar resolution. The technique is applicable to all profiling radars that have sufficient sensitivity to observe the small amount of liquid in mixed‐phase clouds.},

  abstract  = {Retrievals of ice and snow are made from Ka‐ and W‐band zenith‐pointing Doppler radars at Hyytiälä, Finland, during the snow experiment component of the Biogenic Aerosols: Effects on Clouds and Climate (2014) field campaign. In a novel optimal estimation retrieval, mean Doppler velocity is exploited to retrieve a density factor parameter, which modulates the mass, shape, terminal velocity, and backscatter cross sections of ice particles. In a case study including aggregate snow and graupel we find that snow rate and ensemble mean ice density can be retrieved to within 50% of in situ measurements at the surface using dual‐frequency Doppler radar retrievals. While Doppler measurements are essential to the retrieval of particle density, the dual‐frequency ratio provides a strong constraint on particle size. The retrieved density factor is strongly correlated with liquid water path, indicating that riming is the primary process by which the density factor is modulated. Using liquid water path as a proxy for riming, profiles classified as unrimed snow, rimed snow, and graupel exhibit distinct features characteristic of aggregation and riming processes, suggesting the potential to make estimates of process rates from these retrievals. We discuss the potential application of the technique to future satellite missions.},

For this purpose, a separation algorithm is proposed to remove the influence of falling particles from the wind profiler Doppler spectra and to calculate the terminal fall velocity of hydrometeors. The remaining error of both vertical air motion and terminal fall velocity is estimated to be better than 0.1 m s-1 using numerical simulations. This combination of instruments allows direct measurements of in-cloud vertical air velocity and particle terminal fall velocity by means of ground-based remote sensing. The possibility of providing a profile every 10 s with a height resolution of <100 m allows further insight into the process scale of in-cloud dynamics. The results of the separation algorithm are illustrated by two case studies,  the  first  covering  a  deep  frontal  cloud  and  the  second featuring a shallow mixed-phase cloud.},

In this study, laboratory measurements of the terminal velocity υt for a variety of ice particle models settling in viscous fluids, along with wind-tunnel and field measurements of ice particles settling in air, have been analyzed and compared to common methods of computing υt from the literature. It is observed that while these methods work well for a number of particle types, they fail for particles with open geometries, specifically those particles for which the area ratio Ar is small (Ar is defined as the area of the particle projected normal to the flow divided by the area of a circumscribing disc). In particular, the fall speeds of stellar and dendritic crystals, needles, open bullet rosettes, and low-density aggregates are all overestimated. These particle types are important in many cloud types: aggregates in particular often dominate snow precipitation at the ground and vertically pointing Doppler radar measurements. Based on the laboratory data, a simple modification to previous computational methods is proposed, based on the area ratio. This new method collapses the available drag data onto an approximately universal curve, and the resulting errors in the computed fall speeds relative to the tank data are less than 25\% in all cases. Comparison with the (much more scattered) measurements of ice particles falling in air show strong support for this new method, with the area ratio bias apparently eliminated.},

The forward model includes effects such as non-Rayleigh scattering by the radar and molecular and multiple scattering by the lidar. By rigorous treatment of errors and a careful choice of state variables and associated a priori estimates, a seamless retrieval is possible between regions of the cloud detected by both radar and lidar and regions detected by just one of these two instruments. Thus, when the lidar signal is unavailable (for reasons such as strong attenuation), the retrieval tends toward an empirical relationship using radar reflectivity factor and temperature, and when the radar signal is unavailable (such as in optically thin cirrus), accurate retrievals are still possible from the combination of lidar and radiometer. The method is tested first on simulated profiles from aircraft data and then on real observations taken in West Africa. It would be straightforward to expand the approach to include other measurements simply by including a forward model for them.},

The representation of vertical wind velocity, W, in atmospheric models constitutes the largest source of uncertainty in the calculation of the cirrus formation rate. Using global atmospheric simulations with a spatial resolution of 7 km we obtain for the first time a direct estimate of the distribution of W at the scale relevant for cirrus formation, validated against long-term observations at two different ground sites. The standard deviation in W, σ w , varies widely over the globe with the highest values resulting from orographic uplift and convection, and the lowest occurring in the Arctic. Globally about 90% of the simulated σ w values are below 0.1 m s−1 and about one in 104 cloud formation events occur in environments with σ w  > 0.8 m s−1. Combining our estimate with reanalysis products and an advanced cloud formation scheme results in lower homogeneous ice nucleation frequency than previously reported, and a decreasing average ice crystal concentration with decreasing temperature. These features are in agreement with observations and suggest that the correct parameterization of σ w is critical to simulate realistic cirrus properties.},

Due to the third frequency, a characteristic curve can be derived which is almost independent of the underlying particle size distribution and velocity‐size relation.

Two cases of midlatitude anvil cirrus forming under very similar environmental conditions are examined. The case studies benefit from simultaneous observations of vertical velocities in cirrus collected at and around the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site during the U.S. Department of Energy Small Particles in Cirrus field campaign. Observations from both platforms suggest that the majority of vertical velocities in the examined midlatitude anvil cirrus cases are roughly within ±1 m s−1 although higher vertical velocities are occasionally observed. The quality of the vertical velocity comparison between in situ aircraft measurements and ground‐based Doppler radar retrievals depends on the case. For the first case on 23 April 2010, the comparison suggests that the radar retrieval may underestimate vertical velocities in the range between roughly 50 cm s−1 and 1 m s−1. For the second case on 14 June 2010, the agreement between radar and aircraft is excellent, and the differences are largely within the observed variability of vertical velocities within cirrus. Differences in the spatial scales of vertical velocities and turbulence sampled by the aircraft and Doppler radar, which arise due to differences in the temporal resolution of the observational platforms are not found to explain the observed discrepancies. Estimates for the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy agree to within 1 order of magnitude between the two observational platforms.},

The presence of liquid droplets is confirmed using multiple ground-based remote sensors. Corrections for Doppler spectrum broadening due to turbulence, wind shear, and radar beamwidth are applied. As a result of the turbulence broadening correction, the turbulent dissipation rate can also be estimated. This retrieval is demonstrated using measurements from the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program’s (ARM) site in Barrow, Alaska, during the Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (MPACE) of autumn 2004. Comparisons of the retrievals with measurements by research aircraft near Barrow indicate that, on the whole, the retrievals perform well. A small bias in vertical velocity between the retrievals and aircraft measurements is found, based on a statistical comparison of four cases comprising nearly 6 h of data. Turbulent dissipation rate comparisons suggest that the radar-retrieved vertical velocity might be slightly underestimated because of an underestimate of the turbulence broadening correction. However, large uncertainties in aircraft vertical velocity measurements likely impact the comparison.},

The cloud macrophysical, microphysical, and dynamical properties are derived from a suite of active and passive remote sensors. Low-level, single-layer, mixed-phase stratiform clouds are typically topped by a 400–700-m-deep liquid water layer from which ice crystals precipitate. These clouds are strongly dominated (85\% by mass) by liquid water. On average, an in-cloud updraft of 0.4 m s−1 sustains the clouds, although cloud-scale circulations lead to a variability of up to ±2 m s−1 from the average. Dominant scales-of-variability in both vertical air motions and cloud microphysical properties retrieved by this analysis occur at 0.5–10-km wavelengths. In updrafts, both cloud liquid and ice mass grow, although the net liquid mass growth is usually largest. Between updrafts, nearly all ice falls out and/or sublimates while the cloud liquid diminishes but does not completely evaporate. The persistence of liquid water throughout these cloud cycles suggests that ice-forming nuclei, and thus ice crystal, concentrations must be limited and that water vapor is plentiful. These details are brought together within the context of a conceptual model relating cloud-scale dynamics and microphysics.},

Doppler spectra obtained from the radar provide mean vertical velocities as well as detailed spectral shapes that can be used to infer small-scale vertical velocity shear, illuminate cloud microphysical processes, and provide estimates of turbulence dissipation rates. These new observations facilitate the analysis and understanding of in-cloud circulations and the physical processes involved, since the cloud boundaries and dimensions are mapped along with the internal structure of the clouds. Coincident observations from a 915-MHz radar (wind profiler) were used to further define the turbulence structure in and around the clouds. The observations document the detailed vertical and horizontal dimensions of updraft and downdraft circulations in the clouds observed. The two cumuli studied in detail have similar circulation patterns—an updraft core surrounded by downdrafts. Although the clouds have a horizontal depth of only about 700 m, updraft velocities of about 5.5 m s−1 were observed. These updrafts, which are only about 400 m across, exhibit characteristics that are consistent with adiabatic ascent, and penetrate about 150 m into the capping inversion. No penetrating downdrafts are observed within the updraft cores. The downdrafts that flank the updraft on the downwind side of the cloud are relatively narrow (less than 100 m) and extend from cloud top to cloud base. The downdraft on the upwind side of the cloud is about 150 m across and penetrates about 200 m into the detraining cloud mass observed in this part of the cloud. This downdraft appears to be driven by the cooling associated with entrainment mixing at cloud top penetrating through detraining, dynamically inactive parts of the cloud matter. Analysis of the Doppler spectrum at the updraft–downdraft interfaces indicates large Doppler spectral widths due to turbulence and sharp shear zones in the radar sampling volume. Large Doppler spectral widths in the detraining upwind part of the cloud are consistent with the presence of larger droplets. The updraft core structure in one of the clouds has a structure that is consistent with the idea that cumulus clouds are composed of successive bubbles that emerge from the subcloud layer. Thus these small cumuli should be considered as convective complexes rather than simple growing elements that later decay into passive clouds. This study illustrates the potential of millimeter-wavelength radars for studying small cumuli.},

The statistical properties of precipitation echoes are reviewed and related to measurements of atmospheric and WSR-57 weather radar parameters. A digital integrator, successfully adapted to the WSR-57, can reduce power estimate variance below I dB without compromising the resolution of the WSR-57 radar. Although specific design parameters are tied to the WSR-57 parameters, sufficiently general criteria are developed to permit design engineers to relate these results to other radars. We derive the statistical properties of echo power samples averaged both in range and time. Engineering and meteorological factors affecting the type of averaging technique employed (exponential weighted time average and linear range average) and averaging intervals selected are considered in detail. The expected value and variance associated with digital data processing due to the analog-to-digital conversion and the arithmetic operations are analyzed. The engineering requirements necessary to insure a minimal signal degradation due to these effects are given. It is shown that, for integrator parameters used, the variance contributed by the time averaging loop (exponential window function) is small compared with that variance due to range averaging truncation, in turn small compared with the input echo power variance. Relations are derived between integrator and radar parameters and minimum scale of resolved precipitation structure. Sample PPI displays of integrated echo returns from severe convective storms are presented.},

  abstract = {Stratocumulus is one of the most common cloud types globally, with a profound effect on the earth’s radiation budget, and the drizzle process is fundamental in understanding the evolution of these boundary layer clouds. In this paper a combination of 94-GHz Doppler radar and backscatter lidar is used to investigate the microphysical properties of drizzle falling below the base of stratocumulus clouds. The ratio of the radar to lidar backscatter power is proportional to the fourth power of mean size, and so potentially it can provide an accurate size estimate. Information about the shape of the drop size distribution is then inferred from the Doppler spectral width. The algorithm estimates vertical profiles of drizzle parameters such as liquid water content, liquid water flux, and vertical air velocity, assuming that the drizzle size spectrum may be represented by a gamma distribution. The depletion time scale of cloud liquid water through the drizzle process can be estimated when the liquid water path of the cloud is available from microwave radiometers, and observations suggest that this time scale varies from a few days in light drizzle to a few hours in strong drizzle events. Radar and lidar observations from Chilbolton (in southern England) and aircraft size spectra taken during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment have both been used to derive the following power-law relationship between liquid water flux (LWF) (g m−2 s−1) and radar reflectivity (Z) (mm6 m−3): LWF = 0.0093Z0.69. This relation is valid for frequencies up to 94 GHz and therefore would allow a forthcoming spaceborne radar to measure liquid water flux around the globe to within a factor of 2 for values of Z above −20 dBZ.},

  abstract  = {To understand the microphysical processes that impact diabatic heating and cloud lifetimes in convection, we need to characterize the spatial distribution of supercooled liquid water. To address this observational challenge, ground‐based vertically pointing active sensors at the Darwin Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site are used to classify cloud phase within a deep convective cloud. The cloud cannot be fully observed by a lidar due to signal attenuation. Therefore, we developed an objective method for identifying hydrometeor classes, including mixed‐phase conditions, using k‐means clustering on parameters that describe the shape of the Doppler spectra from vertically pointing Ka‐band cloud radar. This approach shows that multiple, overlapping mixed‐phase layers exist within the cloud, rather than a single region of supercooled liquid. Diffusional growth calculations show that the conditions for the Wegener‐Bergeron‐Findeisen process exist within one of these mixed‐phase microstructures. Convective cloud observed containing multiple mixed‐phase layers K‐means clustering of moments of radar spectra identifies layers Conditions favorable for WBF process observed in convective cloud We use radar measurements to identify regions of a thick tropical cloud with both liquid droplets and ice crystals at temperatures colder than 0°C. The coexistence of liquid and ice in the cloud changes how ice crystals grow. Because falling ice crystals melt into rain when they reach warmer air, observing where liquid and ice coexist can help us improve our understanding of when and how much clouds will rain.},

  abstract = {Computer simulations of the aggregation and riming of ice crystals are performed to investigate the geometry of rimed aggregate snowflakes. Due to the universality of the geometry of aggregates, the conversion to a graupel-like particle is self-similar and independent from specific properties of the aggregate, when formulated in properly normalized variables. Hence, the particle habit of the primary crystals, the size of the aggregate or the density of the rime mass, does not lead to a structural change in the transition to graupel. Therefore, this transition can be parameterized by a similarity approach using simulations of many individual rimed aggregates. These parameterizations can replace the classic fill-in model used in many cloud models. The parameterizations are applied and tested in a one-dimensional Lagrangian superparticle model to simulate the growth of aggregates in a liquid layer. We find that the similarity model for the geometry of rimed snowflakes leads to a more rapid growth by riming and, hence, an increased precipitation rate compared to the fill-in model. The main reason for this is that the increase of the maximum dimension during the early stages of riming is properly taken into account by the similarity model, whereas it is neglected by the fill-in model.},

  abstract  = {Cloud radars are unique instruments for observing cloud processes, but uncertainties in radar calibration have frequently limited data quality. Thus far, no single, robust method exists for assessing calibration of past cloud radar data sets. Here, we investigate whether observations of microphysical processes of liquid clouds such as the transition of cloud droplets to drizzle drops can be used to calibrate cloud radars. Specifically, we study the relationships between the radar reflectivity factor and three variables not affected by absolute radar calibration: the skewness of the radar Doppler spectrum (?), the radar mean Doppler velocity (W), and the liquid water path (LWP). We identify reference points of these relationships and evaluate their potential for radar calibration. For Ka and W, we use box model simulations to determine typical radar re?ectivity values for these reference points. We apply the new methods to observations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites North Slope of Alaska (NSA) and Oliktok Point (OLI) in 2016 using two 35 GHz Ka-band ARM Zenith Radars (KAZR). For periods with a suf?cient number of liquid cloud observations, we ?nd that the methods are robust enough for cloud radar calibration, with the LWP-based method performing best. We estimate that in 2016, the radar re?ectivity at NSA was about 1�1 dB too low, but stable. For OLI, we identify serious problems with maintaining an accurate calibration including a sudden decrease of 5 to 7 dB in June 2016.},

  abstract = {In many types of clouds, multiple hydrometeor populations can be present at the same time and height. Studying theevolution of these different hydrometeors in a time-height perspective can give valuable information on cloud particle compositionand microphysical growth processes. However, as a prerequisite, the number of different hydrometeor types in a certaincloud volume needs to be quantified. This can be accomplished using cloud radar Doppler velocity spectra from profilingcloud radars if the different hydrometeor types have sufficiently different terminal fall velocities to produce individual Dopplerspectrum peaks. Here we present a newly developed supervised machine learning radar Doppler spectra peak finding algorithm(named PEAKO). In this approach, three adjustable parameters (spectrum smoothing span, prominence threshold, and minimumpeak width at half-height) are varied to obtain the set of parameters which yields the best agreement of user-classifiedand machine-marked peaks. The algorithm was developed for Ka-band ARM Zenith-pointing Radar (KAZR) observations obtained in thick snow fall systems during the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program’s (ARM) mobile facility AMF2deployment at Hyytiälä, Finland, during the Biogenic Aerosols – Effects on Clouds and Climate (BAECC) field campaign. Theperformance of PEAKO is evaluated by comparing its results to existing Doppler peak finding algorithms. The new algorithmis found to perform well. Its advantage is that the detected features are less noisy and more consistent in time and height thanthe peak finding results of other algorithms. In the future, the PEAKO algorithm will be adapted to other cloud radars and other types of clouds consisting of multiple hydrometeors in the same cloud volume.},

It was observed that existing precipitation is enhanced locally on spatial scales from a few kilometers to several tens of kilometers. The precipitation intensity in these localized areas was 6-14 times higher than the background large-scale precipitation rate. Surface observations and dual-polarization radar data indicate that snowflakes within the ice portion of the falling precipitation in the intensification regions are larger and more isotropic than in the surrounding precipitation. There appears to be an increase in the ice particle number concentration within the intensification region. The observed events were linked to arriving or departing air traffic. We advocate that the mechanism responsible for intensification is aircraft-produced ice particles boosting the aggregation growth of snowflakes.},

  year      = {2018},
  month     = {mar},
  abstract  = {The Arctic has warmed more than twice as fast as the global average since the mid 20th century, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification (AA). These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent events of extreme weather across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes, including extreme heat and rainfall events and recent severe winters. Though winter temperatures have generally warmed since 1960 over mid-to-high latitudes, the acceleration in the rate of warming at high-latitudes, relative to the rest of the NH, started approximately in 1990. Trends since 1990 show cooling over the NH continents, especially in Northern Eurasia. The possible link between Arctic change and mid-latitude climate and weather has spurred a rush of new observational and modeling studies. A number of workshops held during 2013-2014 have helped frame the problem and have called for continuing and enhancing efforts for improving our understanding of Arctic-mid-latitude linkages and its attribution to the occurrence of extreme climate and weather events. Although these workshops have outlined some of the major challenges and provided broad recommendations, further efforts are needed to synthesize the diversified research results to identify where community consensus and gaps exist. Building upon findings and recommendations of the previous workshops, the US CLIVAR Working Group on Arctic Change and Possible Influence on Mid-latitude Climate and Weather convened an international workshop at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, on February 1-3, 2017. Experts in the fields of atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere sciences assembled to assess the rapidly evolving state of understanding, identify consensus on knowledge and gaps in research, and develop specific actions to accelerate progress within the research community. With more than 100 participants, the workshop was the largest and most comprehensive gathering of climate scientists to address the topic to date. In this white paper, we synthesize and discuss outcomes from this workshop and activities involving many of the working group members.},

The science enabled by this constellation flourished with the introduction of the two active sensors carried by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) CloudSat and the NASA?Centre National d?Etudes Spatiales (CNES) Cloud?Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellites that were launched together on 28 April 2006. These two missions have provided a 10-yr demonstration of coordinated formation flying that made it possible to develop integrated products and that offered new insights into key atmospheric processes. The progress achieved over this decade of observations, summarized in this paper, clearly demonstrate the fundamental importance of the vertical structure of clouds and aerosol for understanding the influences of the larger-scale atmospheric circulation on aerosol, the hydrological cycle, the cloud-scale physics, and the formation of the major storm systems of Earth. The research also underscored inherent ambiguities in radiance data in describing cloud properties and how these active systems have greatly enhanced passive observation. It is now clear that monitoring the vertical structure of clouds and aerosol is essential, and a climate data record is now being constructed. These pioneering efforts are to be continued with the Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission planned for launch in 2019.},

  abstract  = {In 2017, the dominant greenhouse gases released into Earth?s atmosphere?carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxidereached new record highs. The annual global average carbon dioxide concentration at Earth?s surface for 2017 was 405.0 � 0.1 ppm, 2.2 ppm greater than for 2016 and the highest in the modern atmospheric measurement record and in ice core records dating back as far as 800 000 years. The global growth rate of CO 2 has nearly quadrupled since the early 1960s. With ENSO-neutral conditions present in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean during most of the year and weak La Ni�a conditions notable at the start and end, the global temperature across land and ocean surfaces ranked as the second or third highest, depending on the dataset, since records began in the mid-to-late 1800s. Notably, it was the warmest non-El Ni�o year in the instrumental record. Above Earth?s surface, the annual lower tropospheric temperature was also either second or third highest according to all datasets analyzed. The lower stratospheric temperature was about 0.2�C higher than the record cold temperature of 2016 according to most of the in situ and satellite datasets. Several countries, including Argentina, Uruguay, Spain, and Bulgaria, reported record high annual temperatures. Mexico broke its annual record for the fourth consecutive year. On 27 January, the temperature reached 43.4�C at Puerto Madryn, Argentina?the highest temperature recorded so far south (43�S) anywhere in the world. On 28 May in Turbat, western Pakistan, the high of 53.5�C tied Pakistan?s all-time highest temperature and became the world-record highest temperature for May. In the Arctic, the 2017 land surface temperature was 1.6�C above the 1981?2010 average, the second highest since the record began in 1900, behind only 2016. The five highest annual Arctic temperatures have all occurred since 2007. Exceptionally high temperatures were observed in the permafrost across the Arctic, with record values reported in much of Alaska and northwestern Canada. In August, high sea surface temperature (SST) records were broken for the Chukchi Sea, with some regions as warm as +11�C, or 3� to 4�C warmer than the longterm mean (1982?present). According to paleoclimate studies, today?s abnormally warm Arctic air and SSTs have not been observed in the last 2000 years. The increasing temperatures have led to decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and thickness. On 7 March, sea ice extent at the end of the growth season saw its lowest maximum in the 37-year satellite record, covering 8 \% less area than the 1981?2010 average. The Arctic sea ice minimum on 13 September was the eighth lowest on record and covered 25 \% less area than the long-term mean. Preliminary data indicate that glaciers across the world lost mass for the 38th consecutive year on record; the declines are remarkably consistent from region to region. Cumulatively since 1980, this loss is equivalent to slicing 22 meters off the top of the average glacier. Antarctic sea ice extent remained below average for all of 2017, with record lows during the first four months. Over the continent, the austral summer seasonal melt extent and melt index were the second highest since 2005, mostly due to strong positive anomalies of air temperature over most of the West Antarctic coast. In contrast, the East Antarctic Plateau saw record low mean temperatures in March. The year was also distinguished by the second smallest Antarctic ozone hole observed since 1988. Across the global oceans, the overall long-term SST warming trend remained strong. Although SST cooled slightly from 2016 to 2017, the last three years produced the three highest annual values observed; these high anomalies have been associated with widespread coral bleaching. The most recent global coral bleaching lasted three full years, June 2014 to May 2017, and was the longest, most widespread, and almost certainly most destructive such event on record. Global integrals of 0?700m and 0?2000-m ocean heat content reached record highs in 2017, and global mean sea level during the year became the highest annual average in the 25-year satellite altimetry record, rising to 77 mm above the 1993 average. In the tropics, 2017 saw 85 named tropical storms, slightly above the 1981?2010 average of 82. The North Atlantic basin was the only basin that featured an above-normal season, its seventh most active in the 164-year record. Three hurricanes in the basin were especially notable. Harvey produced record rainfall totals in areas of Texas and Louisiana, including a storm total of 1538.7 mm near Beaumont, Texas, which far exceeds the previous known U.S. tropical cyclone record of 1320.8 mm. Irma was the strongest tropical cyclone globally in 2017 and the strongest Atlantic hurricane outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean on record with maximum winds of 295 km h ?1 . Maria caused catastrophic destruction across the Caribbean Islands, including devastating wind damage and flooding across Puerto Rico. Elsewhere, the western North Pacific, South Indian, and Australian basins were all particularly quiet. Precipitation over global land areas in 2017 was clearly above the long-term average. Among noteworthy regional precipitation records in 2017, Russia reported its second wettest year on record (after 2013) and Norway experienced its sixth wettest year since records began in 1900. Across India, heavy rain and flood-related incidents during the monsoon season claimed around 800 lives. In August and September, above-normal precipitation triggered the most devastating floods in more than a decade in the Venezuelan states of Bol�var and Delta Amacuro. In Nigeria, heavy rain during August and September caused the Niger and Benue Rivers to overflow, bringing floods that displaced more than 100 000 people. Global fire activity was the lowest since at least 2003; however, high activity occurred in parts of North America, South America, and Europe, with an unusually long season in Spain and Portugal, which had their second and third driest years on record, respectively. Devastating fires impacted British Columbia, destroying 1.2 million hectares of timber, bush, and grassland, due in part to the region?s driest summer on record. In the United States, an extreme western wildfire season burned over 4 million hectares; the total costs of \$18 billion tripled the previous U.S. annual wildfire cost record set in 1991.},

The all-ice cloud geographical distribution is shaped by the interaction of the main low-pressure systems surrounding the continent and the orography, with little links with sea ice fraction. We demonstrate the largest impact of sea ice on SLW (mostly mixed-phase clouds, MPC) in autumn and winter, while it is almost null in summer and intermediate in spring. Monthly variability of MPC shows a maximum fraction at the end of summer and minimum in winter. Conversely, the unglaciated (pure) SLW (USLW) fraction has a maximum at the beginning of summer. Monthly evolutions of MPC and USLW fractions do not differ on the continent. This demonstrates a seasonality in the glaciation process in marine liquid-bearing clouds. From the literature, we identify the pattern of the monthly evolution of the MPC fraction as being similar to the one of the aerosols, which is related to marine biological activity. Marine bioaerosols are known to be ef?cient Ice Nucleating Particles (INPs). The emission of these INPs into the atmosphere from open waters would come on top of the temperature and sea ice fraction seasonalities as factors explaining the mixed-phase clouds monthly evolution.},

  abstract  = {As integration of solar power into the national electric grid rapidly increases, it becomes imperative to improve forecasting of this highly variable renewable resource. Thus, a team of researchers from the public, private, and academic sectors partnered to develop and assess a new solar power forecasting system, Sun4Cast. The partnership focused on improving decision-making for utilities and independent system operators, ultimately resulting in improved grid stability and cost savings for consumers. The project followed a value chain approach to determine key research and technology needs to reach desired results. Sun4Cast integrates various forecasting technologies across a spectrum of temporal and spatial scales to predict surface solar irradiance. Anchoring the system is WRF-Solar, a version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction (NWP) model optimized for solar irradiance prediction. Forecasts from multiple NWP models are blended via the Dynamic Integrated Forecast (DICast) System, which forms the basis of the system beyond about 6 h. For short-range (0?6 h) forecasts, Sun4Cast leverages several observation-based nowcasting technologies. These technologies are blended via the Nowcasting Expert System Integrator (NESI). The NESI and DICast systems are subsequently blended to produce short- to midterm irradiance forecasts for solar array locations. The irradiance forecasts are translated into power with uncertainties quantified using an analog ensemble approach and are provided to the industry partners for real-time decision-making. The Sun4Cast system ran operationally throughout 2015 and results were assessed. This paper analyzes the collaborative design process, discusses the project results, and provides recommendations for best-practice solar forecasting.},

  abstract  = {A 2-yr cloud microphysical property dataset derived from ground-based remote sensors at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site near Barrow, Alaska, was used as input into a radiative transfer model to compute radiative heating rate (RHR) pro?les in the atmosphere. Both the longwave (LW; 5?100 mm) and shortwave (SW; 0.2?5 mm) RHR pro?les show signi?cant month-to-month variability because of seasonal dependence in the vertical pro?les of cloud liquid and ice water contents, with additional contributions from the seasonal dependencies of solar zenith angle, water vapor amount, and temperature. The LW and SW RHR pro?les were binned to provide characteristic pro?les as a function of cloud type and liquid water path (LWP). Single-layer liquid-only clouds are shown to have larger (10?30 K day 21 ) LW radiative cooling rates at the top of the cloud layer than single-layer mixed-phase clouds; this is due primarily to differences in the vertical distribution of liquid water between the two classes. However, differences in SW RHR pro?les at the top of these two classes of clouds are less than 3 K day 21 . The absolute value of the RHR in single-layer ice-only clouds is an order of magnitude smaller than in liquid-bearing clouds. Furthermore, for double-layer cloud systems, the phase and condensed water path of the upper cloud strongly modulate the radiative cooling both at the top and within the lower-level cloud. While sensitivity to cloud overlap and phase has been shown previously, the characteristic RHR pro?les are markedly different between the different cloud classi?cations.},

  abstract  = {Among the many different feedback mechanisms contributing to the Arctic Amplification, clouds play a very important role in the Arctic climate system through their cloud radiative effect. It is therefore important that climate models simulate basic cloud properties like cloud cover and cloud phase correctly. We compare results from the global atmospheric model ECHAM6 to observations from the CALIPSO satellite active lidar instrument using the COSP satellite simulator. Our results show that the model is able to reproduce the spatial distribution and cloud amount in the Arctic to some extent, but that cloud cover has a positive bias (caused by an overestimation of low-level, liquid containing cloud) in regions where the surface is covered by snow or ice. We explored the sensitivity of cloud cover to the strength of surface heat fuxes, but only by increasing surface mixing the observed cloud cover bias cloud be reduced. As ECHAM6 already mixes too strongly in the Arctic, the cloud cover bias can mainly be attributed to cloud microphysical processes. Improvements in the phase partitioning of Arctic low-level clouds could be achieved by a more effective Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process but total cloud cover remained still overestimated. By allowing for a slight supersaturation with respect to ice within the cloud cover scheme, we were able to also reduce this positive cloud cover bias.},

  abstract  = {Tropospheric clouds are a very important component of the climate system and the hydrological cycle in the Arctic and sub-Arctic. Liquid water path (LWP) is one of the key parameters of clouds urgently needed for a variety of studies, including the snow cover and climate modelling at northern latitudes. A joint analysis was made of the LWP values obtained from observations by the SEVIRI satellite instrument and from ground-based observations by the RPGHATPRO microwave radiometer near St Petersburg, Russia (60 ? N, 30 ? E). The time period of selected data sets spans 2 years (December 2012?November 2014) excluding winter months, since the speci?c requirements for SEVIRI observations restrict measurements at northern latitudes in winter when the solar zenith angle is too large. The radiometer measurement site is located very close to the shore of the Gulf of Finland, and our study has revealed considerable differences between the LWP values obtained by SEVIRI over land and over water areas in the region under investigation. Therefore, special attention was paid to the analysis of the LWP spatial distributions derived from SEVIRI observations at scales from 15 to 150 km in the vicinity of St Petersburg. Good agreement between the daily median LWP values obtained from the SEVIRI and the RPG-HATPRO observations was shown: the rms difference was estimated at 0.016 kg m ?2 for a warm season and 0.048 kg m ?2 for a cold season. Over 7 months (February?May and August?October), the SEVIRI and the RPG-HATPRO instruments revealed similar diurnal variations in LWP, while considerable discrepancies between the diurnal variations obtained by the two instruments were detected in June and July. On the basis of reanalysis data, it was shown that the LWP diurnal cycles are characterised by considerable interannual variability.},

  abstract  = {The decline of Arctic sea ice is an integral part of anthropogenic climate change. Sea-ice loss is already having a significant impact on Arctic communities and ecosystems. Its role as a cause of climate changes outside of the Arctic has also attracted much scientific interest. Evidence is mounting that Arctic sea-ice loss can affect weather and climate throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The remote impacts of Arctic sea-ice loss can only be properly represented using models that simulate interactions among the ocean, sea ice, land and atmosphere. A synthesis of six such experiments with different models shows consistent hemispheric-wide atmospheric warming, strongest in the mid-to-high-latitude lower troposphere; an intensification of the wintertime Aleutian Low and, in most cases, the Siberian High; a weakening of the Icelandic Low; and a reduction in strength and southward shift of the mid-latitude westerly winds in winter. The atmospheric circulation response seems to be sensitive to the magnitude and geographic pattern of sea-ice loss and, in some cases, to the background climate state. However, it is unclear whether current-generation climate models respond too weakly to sea-ice change. We advocate for coordinated experiments that use different models and observational constraints to quantify the climate response to Arctic sea-ice loss.},

  abstract  = {CloudSat observations are used in combination with collocated European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis to simulate spaceborne W-band Doppler observations from slant-looking radars. The simulator also includes cross-polarization effects which are relevant if the Doppler velocities are derived from polarization diversity pulse pair correlation. A speci?c conically scanning radar con?guration (WIVERN), recently proposed to the ESA-Earth Explorer 10 call that aims to provide global in-cloud winds for data assimilation, is analysed in detail in this study. One hundred granules of CloudSat data are exploited to investigate the impact on Doppler velocity estimates from three speci?c effects: (1) non-uniform beam ?lling, (2) wind shear and (3) crosstalk between orthogonal polarization channels induced by hydrometeors and surface targets. Errors associated with non-uniform beam ?lling constitute the most important source of error and can account for almost 1 m s ?1 standard deviation, but this can be reduced effectively to less than 0.5 m s ?1 by adopting corrections based on estimates of vertical re?ectivity gradients. Wind-shear-induced errors are generally much smaller (? 0.2 m s ?1 ). A methodology for correcting these errors has been developed based on estimates of the vertical wind shear and the re?ectivity gradient. Low signal-to-noise ratios lead to higher random errors (especially in winds) and therefore the correction (particularly the one related to the wind-shear-induced error) is less effective at low signal-to-noise ratio. Both errors can be underestimated in our model because the CloudSat data do not fully sample the spatial variability of the re?ectivity ?elds, whereas the ECMWF reanalysis may have smoother velocity ?elds than in reality (e.g. they underestimate vertical wind shear). The simulator allows for quanti?cation of the average number of accurate measurements that could be gathered by the Doppler radar for each polar orbit, which is strongly impacted by the selection of the polarization diversity H ? V pulse separation, T hv . For WIVERN a selection close to 20 �s (with a corresponding folding velocity equal to 40 m s ?1 ) seems to achieve the right balance between maximizing the number of accurate wind measurements (exceeding 10 \% of the time at any particular level in the mid-troposphere) and minimizing aliasing effects in the presence of high winds. The study lays the foundation for future studies towards a thorough assessment of the performance of polar orbiting wide-swath W-band Doppler radars on a global scale. The next generation of scanning cloud radar systems and reanalyses with improved resolution will enable a full capture of the spatial variability of the cloud re?ectivity and the in-cloud wind ?elds, thus re?ning the results of this study.},

The frequency relates to how dreary the weather appears, and it is the duration much more than the amount that clouds perceptions. Yet, information about the frequency of rainfall, or precipitation in general, is spotty at best. Here, we analyze a new near-global (60�N?60�S) dataset at hourly time scales and 0.25� resolution. The dataset, the newly calibrated Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH), enables comparison of results with 3-hourly and daily data, which is what has previously been available, and seasonal aspects are also examined. The results are quite sensitive to both the spatial scales of the data and their temporal resolutions, and it is important to get down to hourly values to gain a proper appreciation of the true frequency. At 1� resolution, values are 35 \% higher than for 0.25�. At 3-hourly resolution, they are about 25 \% higher than hourly, and at daily resolution, they are about 150 \% higher than hourly on average. Overall, near-global (60�N?60�S) precipitation occurs 11.0 \% � 1.1 \% (1 sigma) of the time or, alternatively, 89.0 \% of the time it is not precipitating. But outside of the intertropical and South Pacific convergence zones, where values exceed 30 \%, and the arid and desert regions, where values are below 4 \%, the rates are more like 10 \% or so, and over land where most people live, values are closer to about 8 \%.},

This analysis establishes the relationship between large-scale atmospheric circulation and principal determinants of GrIS mass balance: moisture, cloud properties, radiative forcing, and temperature. Using self-organizing maps (SOMs), observations from the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric State, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) project are categorized by daily sea level pressure (SLP) gradient. The results describe in detail how southerly, northerly, and zonal circulation regimes impact observations at Summit Station, Greenland. This southerly regime is linked to large anomalous increases in low-level liquid cloud formation, cloud radiative forcing (CRF), and surface warming at Summit Station. An individual southerly pattern relates to the largest positive anomalies, with the most extreme 25% of cases leading to CRF anomalies above 21 W m−2 and temperature anomalies beyond 8.5°C. Finally, the July 2012 extreme melt event is analyzed, showing that the prolonged ice sheet warming was related to persistence of these southerly circulation patterns, causing an unusually extended period of anomalous CRF and temperature. These results demonstrate a novel methodology, connecting daily atmospheric circulation to a relatively brief record of observations.},

In September and October, AMC occurrence frequency is 20?30 \% lower during a southerly wind when compared to the other wind directions; in November, the variation of AMC occurrence frequency with wind direction is small. The mean liquid water path in November is about half of that in October and September. When the surface is snow free, temperature (T) and speci?c humidity (q) pro?les during a northerly wind are warmer and moister than those for the southerly wind. Northerly wind pro?les have a higher relative humidity to ice (RH i ) and lower atmosphere stability. Furthermore, the AMC occurrence frequency has a positive relationship with RH i and a negative relationship with stability. These two points may explain the lower AMC occurrence frequency during a southerly wind. During a northerly wind, AMCs have larger radar re?ectivity, wider spectrum width, and larger Doppler velocity signatures. The stronger precipitation for AMC during a northerly wind is possibly due to the cleaner air masses from the ocean (north). With the same amount of q, the radar spectrum width has a higher frequency in the larger bins during a northerly wind. Both T, q, and radar re?ectivity, radar spectrum width pro?les show evidence of deposition in the sub-cloud layer in September and October.},

The lead classification algorithm is based on polarimetric features and textural features derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix. The Random Forest classifier is used to investigate the importance of the individual features for lead detection. The precision?recall curve representing the quality of the classification is used to define threshold for a binary lead/sea ice classification.

  abstract  = {Representation of cloud microphysics is a key aspect of simulating clouds. From the early days of cloud modeling, numerical models have relied on an Eulerian approach for all cloud and thermodynamic and microphysics variables. Over time the sophistication of microphysics schemes has steadily increased, from simple representations of bulk masses of cloud and rain in each grid cell, to including different ice particle types and bulk hydrometeor concentrations, to complex schemes referred to as bin or spectral schemes that explicitly evolve the hydrometeor size distributions within each model grid cell. As computational resources grow, there is a clear trend toward wider use of bin schemes, including their use as benchmarks to develop and test simplified bulk schemes. We argue that continuing on this path brings fundamental challenges difficult to overcome. The Lagrangian particle-based probabilistic approach is a practical alternative in which the myriad of cloud and precipitation particles present in a natural cloud is represented by a judiciously selected ensemble of point particles called super-droplets or superparticles. Advantages of the Lagrangian particle-based approach when compared to the Eulerian bin methodology are explained and prospects of applying the method to more comprehensive cloud simulations, for instance targeting deep convection or frontal cloud systems, are discussed.},

This paper deals speci?cally with how aerosols in?uence ice mass production in low-level Arctic mixed-phase clouds. In this study, a 9-year record of aerosol, cloud and atmospheric state properties is used to quantify aerosol in?uence on ice production in mixed-phase clouds. It is found that mixedphase clouds present in a clean aerosol state have higher ice water content (IWC) by a factor of 1.22 to 1.63 at cloud base than do similar clouds in cases with higher aerosol loading. We additionally analyze radar-derived mean Doppler velocities to better understand the drivers behind this relationship, and we conclude that aerosol induced reduction of the ice crystal nucleation rate, together with decreased riming rates in polluted clouds, are likely in?uences on the observed reductions in IWC.},

In polar regions, climate dynamics are controlled by both radiative and non-radiative interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, ice sheets and land surfaces. Precisely quantifying polar feedbacks is required for a process-oriented evaluation of climate models, a clear understanding of the processes responsible for polar climate changes, and a reduction in uncertainty associated with model projections. This quanti?cation can be performed using a simple and consistent approach that is valid for a wide range of feedbacks, offering the opportunity for more systematic feedback analyses and a better understanding of polar climate changes.},

  abstract  = {Pulses of warm and moist air from lower latitudes provide energy to the Arctic and form its main energy source outside of the summer months. These pulses can cause substantial surface warming and trigger ice melt. Air-mass transport in the opposite direction, away from the Arctic, leads to cold-air outbreaks. The outbreaks are often associated with cold extremes over continents, and extreme surface heat fluxes and occasional polar lows over oceans. Air masses advected across the strong Arctic-tomid-latitude temperature gradient are rapidly transformed into colder and dryer or warmer and moister air masses by clouds, radiative and turbulent processes, particularly in the boundary layer. Phase changes from liquid to ice within boundary-layer clouds are critical in these air-mass transformations. The presence of liquid water determines the radiative effects of these clouds, whereas the presence of ice is crucial for subsequent cloud decay or dissipation, processes that are poorly represented in weather and climate models. We argue that a better understanding of how air masses are transformed on their way into and out of the Arctic is essential for improved prediction of weather and climate in the Arctic and mid-latitudes. Observational and modelling exercises should take an air-mass-following Lagrangian approach to attain these goals.},

  abstract  = {The International Summer Snowfall Workshop (ISSW) is a new workshop format for the international scientific community working on ground- and space-based observations, retrievals, and radiative transfer related to snowfall. This new snowfall workshop was inspired by the successful series of International Workshops on Space-based Snowfall Measurements (IWSSM; Bennartz et al. 2011), the latest of which (IWSSM-5) was held concurrently with the International Precipitation Working Group (IPWG) meeting in Bologna, Italy, in 2016. The new biennial ISSW is not intended to replace the IWSSM but rather to provide a forum to discuss specific urgent research topics related to snowfall that have been identified at larger meetings. The first ISSW was held at the University of Cologne, in Cologne, Germany during June 2017. The workshop was attended by about 50 scientists from various universities, research institutions, and weather services in the United States and Europe. The focus topic of this first workshop was the characterization of scattering properties of ice and snow particles at the recommendation of the last joint IWSSM?IPWG meeting in Bologna. Almost 10 years ago, Liu (2008) presented in a BAMS article a freely available scattering database of realistically shaped ice particles; this database is still one of the most-used sources for scattering properties in the microwave region. Since then, not only has the number of datasets and particle habits grown greatly, thanks to increasingly available high-performance computing infrastructure and advances in modeling snowflake formation processes at the single-particle level, but so has their complexity (Fig. 1). There is a broad consensus in the remote sensing community that it is necessary to bring users and developers of scattering databases together to agree on standards and conventions on how to store the complex scattering datasets in a generalized format and according to well-defined quality standards. In addition to a discussion of the progress and current state of scattering computations, the workshop program also addressed topics such as how to better link in situ observations to the particle models used for scattering computations, how to achieve a close interaction between the users and developers of the databases, and how observational constraints can be developed to validate the scattering datasets.},

  abstract  = {Clouds play an important role in Earth?s radiation budget and hydrological cycle. However, current global climate models (GCMs) have difficulties in accurately simulating clouds and precipitation. To improve the representation of clouds in climate models, it is crucial to identify where simulated clouds differ from real-world observations of them. This can be difficult, since significant differences exist between how a climate model represents clouds and what instruments observe, both in terms of spatial scale and the properties of the hydrometeors that are either modeled or observed. To address these issues and minimize impacts of instrument limitations, the concept of instrument ?simulators,? which convert model variables into pseudoinstrument observations, has evolved with the goal to facilitate and improve the comparison of modeled clouds with observations. Many simulators have been (and continue to be) developed for a variety of instruments and purposes. A community satellite simulator package, the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP; Bodas-Salcedo et al. 2011), contains several independent satellite simulators and is being widely used in the GCM community to exploit satellite observations for model cloud evaluation (e.g., Kay et al. 2012; Klein et al. 2013; Suzuki et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2010). This article introduces a ground-based cloud radar simulator developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program for comparing climate model clouds with ARM observations from its vertically pointing 35-GHz radars. As compared to the radar measurements made by CloudSat [a satellite carrying the first spaceborne 94-GHz (3.2-mm wavelength) cloud radar], which provides near-global sampling of profiles of cloud condensate and precipitation with a vertical resolution of 500 m (Stephens et al. 2002), ARM radar measurements occur with higher temporal resolution (10 s) and finer vertical resolution (45 m). This enables users to investigate more fully the detailed vertical structures within clouds, resolve thin clouds, and quantify the diurnal variability of clouds. Particularly, ARM radars are sensitive to low-level clouds, which are difficult for the CloudSat radar to detect due to both surface contamination (Mace et al. 2007; Marchand et al. 2008) and a radar sensitivity of approximately ?28 dBZ near the surface. Therefore, the ARM ground-based cloud observations complement measurements from space.},

Near the convective regions of the rainband, contributions to ICNC can be as large from secondary production as from primary nucleation, but ICNCs greater than 50 L ?1 remain underestimated by the model. The addition of the secondary production parameterizations also clearly intensi?es the differences in both accumulated precipitation and precipitation rate between the convective towers and non-convective gap regions. We suggest, then, that secondary ice production parameterizations be included in large-scale models on the basis of large hydrometeor concentration and convective activity criteria.},

  abstract  = {Ten-year (2004?2013) observations of cloud and surface shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) fluxes at Ny-Alesund were analysed to investigate monthly variations in cloudiness and their impacts on the surface LW radiation budget and near-surface temperature (T s ). The cloud fraction (CF) showed distinct monthly variations, high in summer (0.90) and lower in winter (0.79). The downward SW flux increased from March and showed a peak (~200 W m ?2 ) in June. In contrast, the downward LW (LWD) flux increased from ~200 W m ?2 in February to ~300 W m ?2 in July. Both LWD and upward LW (LWU) fluxes and their difference increased during winter as lowest cloud base height (LCBH) decreased and CF increased. T s difference and both LW fluxes difference (?LWD and ?LWU), calculated as the difference in monthly mean T s and LW between all-sky and cloud-free conditions, were highly correlated (R 2 = 0.68 for LWD and R 2 = 0.92 for LWU). Dramatic changes in T s , CF and LW fluxes at Ny-Alesund were closely associated with cold and warm air mass advection on a multi-day time scale. The average T s under low-level clouds (LCBH ? 2 km) was estimated as ?7.4 � 6.1 �C due to warm air masses advected from the North Atlantic Ocean and Barents Sea, whereas the average T s on cloud-free days was ?14.5 � 5.7 �C because of cold air mass advection from the pole. However, the duration of low-level clouds may not be long enough to drive such large T s variations. 75-percentile of low-level cloud conditions at Ny-Alesund persisted up to 2.3 days, whereas cloud-free and high-altitude cloud (LCBH > 2 km) conditions lasted for approximately 0.8 and 0.5 days, respectively. This implies that cloud LW effects on several warm days may be larger than the monthly average, but may not be accumulated enough to induce surface warming due to abrupt T s drop associated with cold air mass advection.},

Es ist z.B. klar geworden, dass Ver{\"a}nderungen in der Arktis sehr viel gr{\"o}�ere Auswirkungen auf das Klima von Europa haben als man noch vor zehn Jahren angenommen hat. Deutschland kann auf eine lange und erfolgreiche Tradition in der Erforschung der Arktis und Antarktis zur{\"u}ckblicken. Beginnend in der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts haben deutsche Forscher und Forscherinnen wichtige Beitr{\"a}ge geleistet, die international gro�e Anerkennung ?nden. Anfang des 21.

Eine besondere Stellung f�r die universit{\"�}re Antarktisforschung nimmt das DFG-Schwerpunktprogramm ?Antarktisforschung mit vergleichenden Untersuchungen in arktischen Eisgebieten? (SPP1158) ein, das 1981 als Schwerpunktprogramm ?Antarktisforschung? begonnen wurde. Im internationalen Rahmen der Polarforschung ist Deutschland in alle relevanten Organisationen eingebunden. Deutschland ist Mitglied im Wissenschaftlichen Komitee f�r Antarktisforschung (Scienti?c Committee on Antarctic Research, SCAR) und im Internationalen Wissenschaftlichen Komitee f�r Arktisforschung (International Arctic Science Committee, IASC). Dazu hat das Pr{\"a}sidium der DFG im Jahr 1978 einen deutschen Landesausschuss SCAR eingerichtet und diesen im Jahr 1992 mit dem Beitritt der DFG in IASC zum Landesausschuss f�r Forschung in der Antarktis und Arktis erweitert. Das heutige ?Nationalkomitee SCAR/IASC? plant und koordiniert die Aktivit{\"a}ten der deutschen Hochschulforschung auf dem Gebiet der Antarktis- und Arktisforschung zusammen mit dem Alfred-Wegener-Institut sowie den betreffenden staatlichen Einrichtungen. Mitglieder des Nationalkomitees vertreten Deutschland in den internationalen Gremien und nehmen dort z.T. f{\"u}hrende Positionen ein. Im nationalen Rahmen existieren nur wenige umfassende Forschungsprogramme und Strategien zur Polarforschung. Das letzte of?zielle Polarforschungsprogramm der Bundesregierung wurde 1996 publiziert (Polarforschung, Programm der Bundesregierung, BMBF 1996). Ein Hauptziel dieses Programms war, die Haupterkenntnisse auf dem Gebiet der Polarforschung zusammenzufassen und die forschungspolitischen Ziele der n{\"a}chsten Jahre zu setzen. Eine {\"a}hnliche Intention wurde (mit Beschr{\"a}nkung auf die Antarktis) mit der in 2002 erschienenen DFG-Denkschrift ?Deutsche Forschung in der Antarktis, Wissenschaftlicher Fortschritt und Perspektiven? verfolgt. Die Fortschritte der Polarforschung in den letzten Dekaden haben das Nationalkomitee f�r Polarforschung SCAR/IASC dazu veranlasst, eine dem Stand der heutigen Forschung entsprechende Polarforschungsagenda zu verfassen. �hnlich wie das BMBF-Polarforschungsprogramm (1996) sollen sowohl ein m{\"o}glichst allgemein verst{\"a}ndlicher {\"U}berblick {\"u}ber den Stand der Forschung gegeben als auch die Forschungsfragen der kommenden 10-15 Jahre gestellt werden.

  abstract  = {The Arctic is a very pristine and vulnerable region. In this region, climate change
is dramatically apparent by larger temperature changes than in mid-latitudes. Furthermore, aerosol sources are rare in the Arctic resulting in low cloud condensation
nuclei (CCN) concentrations. The Arctic surface is ice covered most of the time,
but changes of the surface occur in the transition seasons spring and autumn.
This leads to interactions with Arctic mixed-phase clouds. They are low-level
clouds and regularly observed in these high latitudes. Moreover, they consist of
supercooled droplets and ice particles at the same time. Depending on the surface
type, Arctic mixed-phase clouds impact the surface radiative heating or cooling
and the turbulent heating. Furthermore, they influence the boundary layer (BL)
structure. Arctic mixed-phase clouds are influenced by changes in atmospheric
conditions and are important for the surface energy balance. Processes that affect
the life cycle of Arctic mixed-phase clouds are relatively poorly understood. Thus,
field campaigns help to understand Arctic mixed-phase clouds and provide data for
model studies to investigate microphysical and macrophysical processes related to
the life cycle of Arctic mixed-phase clouds mechanistically.
This thesis provides new insights into macro- and microphysical properties of
Arctic mixed-phase clouds: first, by comparing semi-idealized large eddy simulations with observations; second, by dissecting the influences of different surface
types and BL structures on Arctic mixed-phase clouds; third, by elucidating the
dissipation process of Arctic mixed-phase clouds; and finally by analyzing the
main microphysical processes inside Arctic mixed-phase clouds.
The VERtical Distribution of Ice in Arctic clouds (VERDI) campaign was an
aircraft campaign over the Beaufort Sea in spring 2012. Flights through clouds
provide microphysical measurements inside mixed-phase clouds. Four different
iAbstract
cases are investigated and compared to simulations with the COnsortium for
Small-Scale MOdeling (COSMO) model. In general, the simulated cloud top,
cloud base, and the liquid water content (LWC) within the cloud layer agree well
with the observations. Differences are seen in the droplet size distribution. The
simulated mean cloud droplet sizes are smaller than the observed droplet sizes due
to the prescribed shape of the distribution in the two-moment scheme of cloud microphysics. The deviation of the observed and simulated droplet diameter profiles
from the wet adiabatic droplet diameter profile is similar. In addition, the cloud
top structure is analyzed. Observations and simulations show an inhomogeneous
characteristic of the cloud top structure. The outcome of this study is a validated
model providing the basis for systematic sensitivity studies, which are described
in more detail below.
Different surface types cause variations in the sensible heat flux and in the latent
heat flux. Thus, altered amount of moisture and heat can propagate into the BL. A
first sensitivity study with three different surface types (sea ice, open lead, and
sea water) shows that the structure of the BL and the surface type are important
and influence the intensity of the surface fluxes. If the BL is well mixed to the
surface, more moisture could reach the cloud layer and increase the cloud liquid
water path. Particularly, the sea water surface influence the moisture transport by
developing a well-mixed BL even when the BL is initially decoupled from the
surface. This sensitivity study elucidates the influences of surface types and BL
structures on Arctic mixed-phase clouds.
The Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) campaign provides a large
dataset of more than a month of observations. Measurements were done on board
the Swedish icebreaker Oden as well as on a multi-year ice floe around 87◦N,
where Oden was moored for three weeks in summer 2008. A second sensitivity
study focus on an episode at the end of the ice drift on 31 August 2008. A low-level
mixed-phase cloud was quasi-persistent for around a week and dissipated in the
evening of 31 August 2008. At the same time, observations showed a decrease in
CCN concentration. Simulations are performed to identify the main contributors
to dissipation of this Arctic mixed-phase cloud. A set of three different sensitivity
experiments mimic large-scale advection of dry air and advection of aerosol. Increasing ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) lead to dissipation of the cloud
only at an ICNC of 10 l−1, which is unrealistically high for the Arctic. Drying
the atmospheric layers below the cloud base has no influence on the mixed-phase
iiAbstract
cloud but drying the atmospheric layers above cloud top lead to a weakening of
the liquid-dominated cloud layer. The main contributor for dissipation was found
to be the reduction of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) to 2 cm−3 in
this specific observed Arctic mixed-phase cloud. While in reality, it is likely that a
combination of different processes contribute to dissipation, this study provides a
detailed analyis of how each process contributes to dissipation.
The same Arctic mixed-phase cloud during the ASCOS campaign as described
before is analyzed to investigate the microphysical process rates inside clouds.
Two groups of simulations, the diagnostic CDNC simulations with initial constant
CDNC (30 cm−3 and 3 cm−3) and the prognostic simulations with aerosol number
concentrations of 30 cm−3 and 80 cm−3, prescribed CCN, and prognostic CDNC
were performed. The ICNC is altered from 0 l−1 to 1 l−1. Different microphysical
process rates are analyzed and the relevant processes are revealed. The warm phase
process (autoconversion of cloud droplets to raindrops) is strongest near the cloud
top, which is the region where the highest LWC is simulated. Additionally, the
strongest sedimentation rate of rain is near the cloud top in all simulations, except
for the simulation with a CDNC of 3 cm−3, where a second layer at about 300 m
above the surface and below the main cloud layer evolves. This cloud system
finally dissipates. Varying the initial ICNC has no influence of the liquid droplet
growth. Furthermore, the cloud lose condensate mainly via the liquid phase and
not via the ice phase. The strongest ice phase process is the depositional growth
of ice in the cloud layer, which indicates that the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen
process has a strong influence on the simulated Arctic mixed-phase cloud. Near
the surface, the ice particles sublimates. This precise sensitivity study evaluates
microphysical processes inside an Arctic mixed-phase cloud and detect the most
important processes.
On the whole, this thesis provides rigorous sensitivity analyses and elucidated
important macrophysical and microphysical processes of Arctic mixed-phase
clouds based on a validated high resolution model.},

However, quantitative evaluation of such feedbacks is still insufficient. Here we provide quantitative evidence that heat input through the open water fraction is the primary driver of seasonal and interannual variations in Arctic sea ice retreat. Analyses of satellite data (1979?2014) and a simplified ice-upper ocean coupled model reveal that divergent ice motion in the early melt season triggers largescale feedback which subsequently amplifies summer sea ice anomalies. The magnitude of divergence controlling the feedback has doubled since 2000 due to a more mobile ice cover, which can partly explain the recent drastic ice reduction in the Arctic Ocean.},

These low-level clouds are frequently observed across the Arctic. They impact the turbulent and radiative heating of the open water, snow, and sea-ice-covered surfaces and in?uence the boundary layer structure. Therefore the processes that affect mixed-phase cloud life cycles are extremely important, yet relatively poorly understood.

We found that one potential main contributor to the dissipation of an observed Arctic mixed-phase cloud, during the Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) ?eld campaign, was a low cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) of about 2 cm ?3 . Introducing a high ice crystal concentration of 10 L ?1 also resulted in cloud dissipation, but such high ice crystal concentrations were deemed unlikely for the present case. Sensitivity studies simulating the advection of dry air above the boundary layer inversion, as well as a modest increase in ice crystal concentration of 1 L ?1 , did not lead to cloud dissipation. As a requirement for small droplet numbers, pristine aerosol conditions in the Arctic environment are therefore considered an important factor determining the lifetime of Arctic mixed-phase clouds.},

  abstract  = {The most prominent September Arctic sea ice decline over the period of 2000?2015 occurs over the Siberian Sea, Laptev Sea, and Kara Sea. The satellite observed and retrieved sea ice concentration (SIC) and cloud/radiation properties over the Arctic (70�?90�N) have been used to investigate the impact of springtime cloud and radiation properties on September SIC variation. Positive trends of cloud fractions, cloud water paths, and surface downward longwave ?ux at the surface over the September sea ice retreat areas are found over the period of 1 March to 14 May, while negative trends are found over the period of 15 May to 28 June. The spatial distributions of correlations between springtime cloud/radiation properties and September SIC have been calculated, indicating that increasing cloud fractions and downward longwave ?ux during springtime tend to enhance sea ice melting due to strong cloud warming effect. Surface downward and upward shortwave ?uxes play an important role from May to June when the onset of sea ice melting occurs. The comparison between linearly detrended and nondetrended of each parameter indicates that signi?cant impact of cloud and radiation properties on September sea ice retreat occurs over the Chukchi/Beaufort Sea at interannual time scale, especially over the period of 31 March to 29 April, while strongest climatological trends are found over the Laptev/Siberian Sea.},

  abstract  = {Cloud feedbacks and processes have been clearly highlighted as a leading source of uncertainty for understanding global climate sensitivity (IPCC 2007). Clouds play fundamental and complex roles in the climate system by redistributing heat and moisture through modulation of atmospheric radiation, latent heating processes, and serving as a critical link in the hydrological cycle. They are affected by aerosol properties, large-scale circulation patterns, interactions with the surface, and tropospheric thermodynamic structure. Importantly, cloud systems are entwined in many feedbacks acting on both large and small scales (Stephens 2005). At the crux of the signi?cant uncertainty associated with cloud processes is the fact that all of these properties, processes, and interactions of clouds with the earth?s climate system vary widely across the globe leading to a diversity, variability, and complexity of cloud systems that is dif?cult to represent using numerical models. Reaching climate equilibrium after some perturbation to the system can take decades of model simulated time; however, Gregory and Webb (2008) and Andrews and Forster (2008) found that changes in clouds that are typically attributed to feedbacks (i.e., Soden et al. 2004; Dufresne and Bony 2008) are actually realized rapidly after a sudden CO2 doubling. These findings are consistent with Williams and Tselioudis (2007) who show that much of the disparity between models and observations is because models fail to represent clouds accurately within present-day meteorological regimes. This distinction is important because feedbacks are largely beyond the reach of observations. However, a rapid response by clouds to altered meteorological regimes suggests that much of the uncertainty in what is normally termed cloud feedbacks arises because of differences in how the parameterized macro- and microphysical properties of clouds respond to changes locally. This further implies that improved understanding of the interactions between cloud processes and the broader climate system in the present climate can have a direct bearing on the fidelity of climate change predictions if that understanding can be encoded in models. Thus, understanding cloud systems at a physical process level is critical to advancing numerical earth system modeling abilities. Such a need for process level understanding is becoming increasingly important as numerical models move to finer and finer spatial scales. It is not unreasonable to assume that global cloud resolving models (Satoh et al. 2008) will be the preferred modeling tools in the future. As convective parameterizations are abandoned in favor of explicit microphysical parameterizations, it is the microphysical parameterizations that are increasingly being recognized as the weak link (Bryan and Morrison 2012; Han et al. 2013). Advancing numerical earth system modeling abilities requires tackling the complexities of clouds, including the following: formation processes and particle nucleation; transfer of water among three phases; evolution of particle size distributions related to growth, autoconversion, dynamics, and entrainment; growth regimes that lead to cloud particles of different shapes, sizes, and fall speeds; and scattering and absorption of atmospheric radiation. To date many of these processes have been difficult to unravel and describe with predictive skill because they are difficult to observe. Many processes, such as entrainment and cloud particle formation, are largely hidden from direct observational capabilities. Further, the dimensionality of the problem (i.e., complexity of cloud systems) is much greater than the available observational constraints. These deficiencies together call for dedicated efforts to expand and improve cloud observational abilities in the form of new measurement technologies and sophisticated analytical tools that are better able to probe deeply into cloud processes and ultimately better constrain the cloud problem. Over the past two decades, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program (Stokes and Schwartz 1994; Ackerman and Stokes 2003) has taken a leading role in addressing the observational and modeling complexities of clouds. One foundational objective of the ARM Program has been to improve the representation of clouds in numerical models. To support this objective, the program has developed and operated diverse suites of ground-based cloud-sensing instrumentation at several geographically diverse locations. These efforts have produced publicly available cloud observational records that are historically unprecedented in length, continuity, and sophistication. A major thrust of ARM?s cloud activities has been in the development of cloud retrieval algorithms wherein instrument-level measurements are exploited to derive the geophysical properties of clouds that are needed to understand and represent cloud processes. These retrieval algorithms are a critical step in bridging the gap between basic measurements and model improvement. They provide input to observational and modeling process studies that are used to synthesize and generalize cloud knowledge in order to support model parameterization development. Here we provide an historical overview of ARM?s contributions toward cloud property retrievals. The overview covers advances in using specific passive and active instruments that are in operation at ARM sites and the expansion of multisensor retrieval approaches. It also addresses the general topic of uncertainty, how it is evaluated, and what it means for our ability to use cloud information derived from ground-based sensors. While there have been many individual contributions over the past two decades from investigators supported by ARM, the focus here is primarily on the larger movements and novel accomplishments that distinguish the ARM Program as a global leader in cloud research and retrieval development. We conclude with a look at the pathway forward, considering the possibilities presented by new enhanced measurements, the need to develop sophisticated forward models relating physical processes to observational parameters, and how these together can further advance cloud retrievals.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the effect of sea ice reduction on Arctic cloud cover in historical simulations with the coupled atmosphere?ocean general circulation model MIROC5. Arctic sea ice has been substantially retreating since the 1980s, particularly in September, under simulated global warming conditions. The simulated sea ice reduction is consistent with satellite observations. On the other hand, Arctic cloud cover has been increasing in October, with about a 1-month lag behind the sea ice reduction. The delayed response leads to extensive sea ice reductions because the heat and moisture fluxes from the underlying open ocean into the atmosphere are enhanced. Sensitivity experiments with the atmospheric part of MIROC5 clearly show that sea ice reduction causes increases in cloud cover. Arctic cloud cover increases primarily in the lower troposphere, but it decreases in the near-surface layers just above the ocean; predominant temperature rises in these near-surface layers cause drying (i.e., decreases in relative humidity), despite increasing moisture flux. Cloud radiative forcing due to increases in cloud cover in autumn brings an increase in the surface downward longwave radiation (DLR) by approximately 40-60 \% compared to changes in clear-sky surface DLR in fall. These results suggest that an increase in Arctic cloud cover as a result of reduced sea ice coverage may bring further sea ice retreat and enhance the feedback processes of Arctic warming.},

By embedding a lidar simulator within CAM5, the idiosyncrasies of spaceborne lidar cloud detection and phase assignment are replicated. As a result, this study makes scale-aware and de?nition-aware comparisons between model-simulated and observed cloud amount and cloud phase. In the global mean, CAM5 has insuf?cient liquid cloud and excessive ice cloud when compared to CALIPSO observations. Over the ice-covered Arctic Ocean, CAM5 has insuf?cient liquid cloud in all seasons. Having important implications for projections of future sea level rise, a liquid cloud de?cit contributes to a cold bias of 2?3�C for summer daily maximum near-surface air temperatures at Summit, Greenland. Over the midlatitude storm tracks, CAM5 has excessive ice cloud and insuf?cient liquid cloud. Storm track cloud phase biases in CAM5 maximize over the Southern Ocean, which also has larger-than-observed seasonal variations in cloud phase. Physical parameter modi?cations reduce the Southern Ocean cloud phase and shortwave radiation biases in CAM5 and illustrate the power of the CALIPSO observations as an observational constraint. The results also highlight the importance of using a regime-based, as opposed to a geographic-based, model evaluation approach. More generally, the results demonstrate the importance and value of simulator-enabled comparisons of cloud phase in models used for future climate projection.},

  abstract  = {In situ airborne observations of cloud microphysics, aerosol properties, and thermodynamic structure over the transition from sea ice to ocean are presented from the Aerosol-Cloud Coupling And Climate Interactions in the Arctic (ACCACIA) campaign. A case study from 23 March 2013 provides a unique view of the cloud microphysical changes over this transition under cold-air outbreak conditions. Cloud base lifted and cloud depth increased over the transition from sea ice to ocean. Mean droplet number concentrations, N drop , also increased from 110 � 36 cm ?3 over the sea ice to 145 � 54 cm ?3 over the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Downstream over the ocean, N drop decreased to 63 � 30 cm ?3 . This reduction was attributed to enhanced collision-coalescence of droplets within the deep ocean cloud layer. The liquid water content increased almost four fold over the transition and this, in conjunction with the deeper cloud layer, allowed rimed snow?akes to develop and precipitate out of cloud base downstream over the ocean. The ice properties of the cloud remained approximately constant over the transition. Observed ice crystal number concentrations averaged approximately 0.5?1.5 L ?1 , suggesting only primary ice nucleation was active; however, there was evidence of crystal fragmentation at cloud base over the ocean. Little variation in aerosol particle number concentrations was observed between the different surface conditions; however, some variability with altitude was observed, with notably greater concentrations measured at higher altitudes (> 800 m) over the sea ice. Near-surface boundary layer temperatures increased by 13 ? C from sea ice to ocean, with corresponding increases in surface heat ?uxes and turbulent kinetic energy. These signi?cant thermodynamic changes were concluded to be the primary driver of the microphysical evolution of the cloud. This study represents the ?rst investigation, using in situ airborne observations, of cloud microphysical changes with changing sea ice cover and addresses the question of how the microphysics of Arctic stratiform clouds may change as the region warms and sea ice extent reduces.},

  abstract  = {When the ARM Program embarked on its quest to select sites for the proposed ground-based atmospheric observatories, there was a broad consensus that more than one site was needed. One site had to be in the equatorial regions, where a disproportionate share of the solar energy fueling Earth?s atmospheric general circulation is received, and the other in a polar location, where radiant energy lost to space greatly exceeds the energy received by the sun. While the latitudinal energy imbalance suggested a polar site, an Arctic location was preferred, because the Arctic plays a stronger role in the general circulation than does the Antarctic (Crowley and North 1991). As far back as 1896, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius suggested that changes in Earth?s atmospheric composition would lead to faster changes in the Arctic compared to the rest of the globe (Arrhenius 1896), a process con?rmed by general circulation models and now called Arctic ampli?cation [e.g., see summary in Serreze and Barry (2011)]. The high sensitivity of the Arctic to climate change is a result of the susceptibility of the cryosphere (sea ice, land ice, and permafrost) to changes in energy ?uxes and in?uential feedback processes. For example, over the Arctic sea ice, the strong sea ice?albedo feedback ampli?es the observed decline in ice extent (e.g., Wendler et al. 2010). Faster changes in the Arctic relative to lower latitudes disturb the latitudinal energy balance and, hence, the general circulation patterns in both the oceans and atmosphere, impacting the entire globe. It may be said that what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic! Low temperatures in the Arctic result in low water vapor mixing ratios in the atmosphere, low enough that additional spectral regions, such as the water vapor rotational absorption bands in Earth?s emission spectrum, become semitransparent in the cloudless atmosphere, increasing radiative energy losses from the surface (Stamnes et al. 1999). The presence of clouds in the atmosphere alters the atmospheric radiative absorption spectrum and thus has a strong in?uence on the surface energy budget and radiative losses to space. Most Arctic clouds are found in the lower troposphere, where they interact with strong and persistent near-surface temperature inversions, a characteristic of the Arctic environment (Serreze et al. 1992). Most of the uncertainties in the Arctic radiation budget are associated with an incomplete understanding of the process interactions between Earth?s surface and the atmosphere through this interfacial layer. Complex interactions involving surface?atmosphere energy and water vapor exchange, multiphase cloud processes, the strati?ed lower troposphere, and radiative energy pro?les combine to make the high latitudes challenging to represent accurately in numerical weather prediction and climate models. These challenges together motivated the ARM Program to establish an Arctic observatory to study the many processes that regulate the ?ow of radiative energy through the atmospheric system.},

It was carried out over the pack ice in the northern Fram Strait in March 2013. We present case studies of the boundary layer modi?cation and turbulent ?uxes over four wide leads, which differed strongly with respect to lead characteristics and environmental conditions. The observed near-surface sensible heat ?uxes ranged from 15 to 180 W m ?2 . The leads also induced an increase of the near-surface temperature of up to 3.2 ? C and a humidity increase of up to 0.2 g kg ?1 . In one of the cases, large entrainment ?uxes exceeding 30 \% of the surface ?uxes were observed. Vertical pro?les of turbulent sensible heat and momentum ?uxes were nonlinear downstream of the leads with a distinct ?ux maximum in the core of the convective plumes. In two cases, the plumes also strongly affected the wind ?eld within the atmospheric boundary layer. Low-level jets that existed in those cases in the region upstream of the leads disappeared in the plume region. Finally, it is shown that large errors can occur when ?ux measurements are derived from lead orthogonal ?ight legs only. Therefore, complex ?ight patterns, as presented in this study, are necessary to accurately determine the energy ?uxes in the environment of leads.},

AMC has an annual occurrence frequency of 42.3 \%, which includes 18.7 \% of single-layered AMCs and 23.6 \% for multiple layers. Two cloud base heights (CBHs) are de?ned from ceilometer and micropulse lidar (MPL) measurements. For single-layered AMC, the ceilometer-derived CBH represents the base of the liquid-dominant layer near the cloud top, while MPL-derived CBH represents base of the lower ice-dominant layer. The annual mean CBHs from ceilometer and MPL measurements are 1.0 km and 0.6 km, respectively, with the largest difference (~1.0 km) occurring from December to March and the smallest difference in September. The humidity inversion occurrence decreases with increasing humidity inversion intensity (stronger in summer than in winter). During the winter months, AMC occurrences increase from 15 \% to 35 \% when the inversion intensity increases from 0.1 to 0.9 g/kg. On the contrary, despite a higher frequency of strong humidity inversion in summer, AMC occurrences are nearly invariant for different inversion intensities. On average, humidity and temperature inversion frequencies of occurrence above an AMC are 5 and 8 times, respectively, as high as those below an AMC. The strong inversion occurrences for both humidity and temperature above an AMC provide the moisture sources from above for the formation and maintenance of AMCs. This result helps to reconcile the persistency of AMCs even when the Arctic surface is covered by snow and ice.},

An Arctic-speci?c, ground-based, multisensor cloud retrieval system is described here and applied to 2 yr of observations from Barrow, Alaska. Over these 2 yr, clouds occurred 75 \% of the time, with cloud ice and liquid each occurring nearly 60 \% of the time. Liquid water occurred at least 25 \% of the time, even in winter, and existed up to heights of 8 km. The vertically integrated mass of liquid was typically larger than that of ice. While it is generally dif?cult to evaluate the overall uncertainty of a comprehensive cloud retrieval system of this type, radiative ?ux closure analyses were performed in which ?ux calculations using the derived microphysical properties were compared with measurements at the surface and the top of the atmosphere. Radiative closure biases were generally smaller for cloudy scenes relative to clear skies, while the variability of ?ux closure results was only moderately larger than under clear skies. The best closure at the surface was obtained for liquid-containing clouds. Radiative closure results were compared with those based on a similar, yet simpler, cloud retrieval system. These comparisons demonstrated the importance of accurate cloud-phase and cloud-type classi?cation, and speci?cally the identi?cation of liquid water, for determining radiative ?uxes. Enhanced retrievals of liquid water path for thin clouds were also shown to improve radiative ?ux calculations.},

  abstract  = {Polynyas and leads are key elements of the wintertime Arctic sea-ice cover. They play a crucial role in surface heat loss, potential ice formation and consequently in the seasonal sea-ice budget. While polynyas are generally sufficiently large to be observed with passive microwave satellite sensors, the monitoring of narrow leads requires the use of data at a higher spatial resolution. We apply and evaluate different lead segmentation techniques based on sea-ice surface temperatures as measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Daily lead composite maps indicate the presence of cloud artifacts that arise from ambiguities in the segmentation process and shortcomings in the MODIS cloud mask. A fuzzy cloud artifact filter is hence implemented to mitigate these effects and the associated potential misclassification of leads. The filter is adjusted with reference data from thermal infrared image sequences, and applied to daily MODIS data from January to April 2008. The daily lead product can be used to deduct the structure and dynamics of wintertime sea-ice leads and to assess seasonal divergence patterns of the Arctic Ocean.},

  abstract  = {The presence of sea-ice leads represents a key feature of the Arctic sea ice cover. Leads promote the ?ux of sensible and latent heat from the ocean to the cold winter atmosphere and are thereby crucial for air-sea-ice-ocean interactions. We here apply a binary segmentation procedure to identify leads from MODIS thermal infrared imagery on a daily time scale. The method separates identi?ed leads into two uncertainty categories, with the high uncertainty being attributed to artifacts that arise from warm signatures of unrecognized clouds. Based on the obtained lead detections, we compute quasi-daily pan-Arctic lead maps for the months of January to April, 2003?2015. Our results highlight the marginal ice zone in the Fram Strait and Barents Sea as the primary region for lead activity. The spatial distribution of the average pan-Arctic lead frequencies reveals, moreover, distinct patterns of predominant fracture zones in the Beaufort Sea and along the shelf-breaks, mainly in the Siberian sector of the Arctic Ocean as well as the well-known polynya and fast-ice locations. Additionally, a substantial interannual variability of lead occurrences in the Arctic is indicated.},

  abstract  = {The Arctic region is known to be very sensitive toclimate change. Clouds and in particular mixed-phase clouds(MPCs) remain one of the greatest sources of uncertainties inthe modelling of the Arctic response to climate change dueto an inaccurate representation of their variability and theirquantification. In this study, we present a characterisation ofthe vertical, spatial and seasonal variability of Arctic cloudsand MPCs over the entire Arctic region based on satelliteactive remote sensing observations. MPC properties in theregion of the Svalbard archipelago (78 N, 15 E) are also investigated.The occurrence frequency of clouds and MPCsare determined from CALIPSO/CLOUDSAT measurementsprocessed with the DARDAR retrieval algorithm, which allowfor a reliable cloud thermodynamic phase classification(warm liquid, supercooled liquid, ice, mixing of ice and supercooledliquid). Significant differences are observed betweenMPC properties over the entire Arctic region and overthe Svalbard region. Results show that MPCs are encounteredall year long, with a minimum occurrence of 30% inwinter and 50% during the rest of the year on average overthe entire Arctic. Over the Svalbard region, MPC occurrenceis more constant with time with larger values (55 %) comparedto the average observed in the Arctic. MPCs are especiallylocated at low altitudes, below 3000 m, where theirfrequency of occurrence reaches 90 %, particularly duringwinter, spring and autumn. Moreover, results highlight thatMPCs are statistically more frequent above open sea thanland or sea ice. The temporal and spatial distribution ofMPCs over the Svalbard region seems to be linked to thesupply of moister air and warmer water from the North AtlanticOcean, which contribute to the initiation of the liquidwater phase. Over the whole Arctic, and particularly in westernregions, the increase of MPC occurrence from spring toautumn could be connected to the sea ice melting. Duringthis period, the open water transports some of the warm waterfrom the North Atlantic Ocean to the rest of the Arcticregion. This facilitates the vertical transfer of moisture andthus the persistence of the liquid phase. Particular attentionis also paid to the measurement uncertainties and how theycould affect our conclusions.},

  abstract  = {The Arctic climate system includes numerous highly interactive small-scale physical processes in the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean. During and since the International Polar Year 2007–2009, significant advances have been made in understanding these processes. Here, these recent advances are reviewed, synthesized, and discussed. In atmospheric physics, the primary advances have been in cloud physics, radiative transfer, mesoscale cyclones, coastal, and fjordic processes as well as in boundary layer processes and surface fluxes. In sea ice and its snow cover, advances have been made in understanding of the surface albedo and its relationships with snow properties, the internal structure of sea ice, the heat and salt transfer in ice, the formation of superimposed ice and snow ice, and the small-scale dynamics of sea ice. For the ocean, significant advances have been related to exchange processes at the ice–ocean interface, diapycnal mixing, double-diffusive convection, tidal currents and diurnal resonance. Despite this recent progress, some of these small-scale physical processes are still not sufficiently understood: these include wave–turbulence interactions in the atmosphere and ocean, the exchange of heat and salt at the ice–ocean interface, and the mechanical weakening of sea ice. Many other processes are reasonably well understood as stand-alone processes but the challenge is to understand their interactions with and impacts and feedbacks on other processes. Uncertainty in the parameterization of small-scale processes continues to be among the greatest challenges facing climate modelling, particularly in high latitudes. Further improvements in parameterization require new year-round field campaigns on the Arctic sea ice, closely combined with satellite remote sensing studies and numerical model experiments.},

  abstract  = {The areal extent, concentration and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas have strongly decreased during the recent decades, but cold, snow-rich winters have been common over mid-latitude land areas since 2005. A review is presented on studies addressing the local and remote effects of the sea ice decline on weather and climate. It is evident that the reduction in sea ice cover has increased the heat flux from the ocean to atmosphere in autumn and early winter. This has locally increased air temperature, moisture, and cloud cover and reduced the static stability in the lower troposphere. Several studies based on observations, atmospheric reanalyses, and model experiments suggest that the sea ice decline, together with increased snow cover in Eurasia, favours circulation patterns resembling the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation. The suggested large-scale pressure patterns include a high over Eurasia, which favours cold winters in Europe and northeastern Eurasia. A high over the western and a low over the eastern North America have also been suggested, favouring advection of Arctic air masses to North America. Mid-latitude winter weather is, however, affected by several other factors, which generate a large inter-annual variability and often mask the effects of sea ice decline. In addition, the small sample of years with a large sea ice loss makes it difficult to distinguish the effects directly attributable to sea ice conditions. Several studies suggest that, with advancing global warming, cold winters in mid-latitude continents will no longer be common during the second half of the twenty-first century. Recent studies have also suggested causal links between the sea ice decline and summer precipitation in Europe, the Mediterranean, and East Asia.},

  abstract  = {Clouds and associated precipitation are the largest source of uncertainty in current weather and future climate simulations. Observations of the microphysical, dynamical and radiative processes that act at cloud scales are needed to improve our understanding of clouds. The rapid expansion of ground-based super-sites and the availability of continuous pro?ling and scanning multi-frequency radar observations at 35 and 94 GHz have signi?cantly improved our ability to probe the internal structure of clouds in high temporal-spatial resolution, and to retrieve quantitative cloud and precipitation properties. However, there are still gaps in our ability to probe clouds due to large uncertainties in the retrievals. The present work discusses the potential of G band (frequency between 110 and 300 GHz) Doppler radars in combination with lower frequencies to further improve the retrievals of microphysical properties. Our results show that, thanks to a larger dynamic range in dual-wavelength re?ectivity, dual-wavelength attenuation and dual-wavelength Doppler velocity (with respect to a Rayleigh reference), the inclusion of frequencies in the G band can signi?cantly improve current pro?ling capabilities in three key areas: boundary layer clouds, cirrus and mid-level ice clouds, and precipitating snow.},

Two general typesof cloud structures are examined: the “neutrally stratified”and “stably stratified” clouds. Neutrally stratified are mixedphaseclouds where radiative-cooling near cloud top producesturbulence that generates a cloud-driven mixed layer.When this layer mixes with the surface-generated turbulence,the cloud layer is coupled to the surface, whereas when suchan interaction does not occur, it remains decoupled; the latterstate is most frequently observed. The decoupled cloudsare usually higher compared to the coupled; differences inthickness or cloud water properties between the two casesare however not found. The surface fluxes are also verysimilar for both states. The decoupled clouds exhibit a bimodalthermodynamic structure, depending on the depth ofthe sub-cloud mixed layer (SCML): clouds with shallowerSCMLs are disconnected from the surface by weak inversions,whereas those that lay over a deeper SCML are associatedwith stronger inversions at the decoupling height.Neutrally stratified clouds generally precipitate; the evaporation/sublimation of precipitation often enhances the decouplingstate. Finally, stably stratified clouds are usually lower,geometrically and optically thinner, non-precipitating liquidwaterclouds, not containing enough liquid to drive efficientmixing through cloud-top cooling.},

  abstract  = {Cloud phase de?nes many cloud properties and determines the ways in which clouds interact with other aspects of the climate system. The occurrence fraction and characteristics of clouds distinguished by their phase are examined at three Arctic atmospheric observatories. Each observatory has the basic suite of instruments that are necessary to identify cloud phase, namely, cloud radar, depolarization lidar, microwave radiometer, and twice-daily radiosondes. At these observatories, ice clouds are more prevalent than mixed-phase clouds, which are more prevalent than liquid-only clouds. Cloud ice occurs 60 \%?70 \% of the time over a typical year, at heights up to 11 km. Liquid water occurs at temperatures above 2408C and is increasingly more likely as temperatures increase. Within the temperature range from 2408 to 2308C, liquid water occurs in 3 \%?5 \% of the observed cloudiness. Liquid water is found higher in the atmosphere when accompanied by ice; there are few liquid-only clouds above 3 km, although liquid in mixed-phase clouds occurs at heights up to about 7?8 km. Regardless of temperature or height, liquid water occurs 56 \% of the time at Barrow, Alaska, and at a western Arctic Ocean site, but only 32 \% of the time at Eureka, Nunavut, Canada. This signi?cant difference in liquid occurrence is due to a relatively dry lower troposphere during summer at Eureka in addition to warmer cloud temperatures with more persistent liquid water layers at the far western locations. The most persistent liquid clouds at these locations occur continuously for more than 70 h in the autumn and more than 30 h in the winter. Ice clouds persist for much longer than do liquid clouds at Eureka and occur more frequently in the winter season, leading to a total cloud occurrence annual cycle that is distinct from the other observatories.},

Each observatory has some combination of cloud lidar, radar, ceilometer, and/or interferometer for identifying and characterizing clouds. By optimally combining measurements from these instruments, it is found that annual cloud occurrence fractions are 58 \%?83 \% at the Arctic observatories. There is a clear annual cycle wherein clouds are least frequent in the winter and most frequent in the late summer and autumn. Only in Eureka, Nunavut, Canada, is the annual cycle shifted such that the annual minimum is in the spring with the maximum in the winter. Intersite monthly variability is typically within 10 \%?15 \% of the all-site average. Interannual variability at speci?c sites is less than 13 \% for any given month and, typically, is less than 3 \% for annual total cloud fractions. Low-level clouds are most persistent at the observatories. The median cloud persistence for all observatories is 3?5 h; however, 5 \% of cloud systems at far western Arctic sites are observed to occur for longer than 100 consecutive hours. Weak diurnal variability in cloudiness is observed at some sites, with a daily minimum in cloud occurrence near solar noon for those seasons for which the sun is above the horizon for at least part of the day.},

Arctic ampli?cation is now recognized as an inherent characteristic of the global climate system, with multiple intertwined causes operating on a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. These include, but are not limited to, changes in sea ice extent that impact heat ?uxes between the ocean and the atmosphere, atmospheric and oceanic heat transports, cloud cover and water vapor that alter the longwave radiation ?ux to the surface, soot on snow and heightened black carbon aerosol concentrations. Strong warming over the Arctic Ocean during the past decade in autumn and winter, clearly associated with reduced sea ice extent, is but the most recent manifestation of the phenomenon. Indeed, periods of Arctic ampli?cation are evident from analysis of both warm and cool periods over at least the past three million years. Arctic ampli?cation being observed today is expected to become stronger in coming decades, invoking changes in atmospheric circulation, vegetation and the carbon cycle, with impacts both within and beyond the Arctic.},

While near-surface temperature and humidity are minimally affected by sea ice loss in July 2007 forecasts, near-surface stability decreases and atmospheric humidity increases aloft over newly open water in September 2007 forecasts. Ubiquitous low cloud increases over the newly ice-free Arctic Ocean are found in both the July 2007 and the September 2007 forecasts. In response to the 2007 sea ice loss, net surface [top of the atmosphere (TOA)] energy budgets change by 119.4 W m 22 (121.0 W m 22 ) and 217.9 W m 22 (11.4 W m 22 ) in the July 2007 and September 2007 forecasts, respectively. While many aspects of the forecasted response to sea ice loss are consistent with physical expectations and available observations, CAM4?s ubiquitous July 2007 cloud increases over newly open water are not. The unrealistic cloud response results from the global application of parameterization designed to diagnose stratus clouds based on lower-tropospheric stability (CLDST). In the Arctic, the well-mixed boundary layer assumption implicit in CLDST is violated. Requiring a well-mixed boundary layer to diagnose stratus clouds improves the CAM4 cloud response to sea ice loss and increases July 2007 surface (TOA) energy budgets over newly open water by 111 W m 22 (114.9 W m 22 ). Of importance to high-latitude climate feedbacks, unrealistic stratus cloud compensation for sea ice loss occurs only when stable and dry atmospheric conditions exist. Therefore, coupled climate projections that use CAM4 will underpredict Arctic sea ice loss only when dry and stable summer conditions occur.},

Different types of clouds have different effects on sea ice. Visual cloud reports from land and ocean regions of the Arctic are analyzed here for interannual variations of total cloud cover and nine cloud types, and their relation to sea ice. Over the high Arctic, cloud cover shows a distinct seasonal cycle dominated by low stratiform clouds, which are much more common in summer than winter. Interannual variations of cloud amounts over the Arctic Ocean show signi?cant correlations with surface air temperature, total sea ice extent, and the Arctic Oscillation. Low ice extent in September is generally preceded by a summer with decreased middle and precipitating clouds. Following a low-ice September there is enhanced low cloud cover in autumn. Total cloud cover appears to be greater throughout the year during low-ice years. Multidecadal trends from surface observations over the Arctic Ocean show increasing cloud cover, which may promote ice loss by longwave radiative forcing. Trends are positive in all seasons, but are most signi?cant during spring and autumn, when cloud cover is positively correlated with surface air temperature. The coverage of summertime precipitating clouds has been decreasing over the Arctic Ocean, which may promote ice loss.},

Most of the optical depth increase is due to the presence of geometrically thicker clouds over water. In addition, our analysis indicates that over the last 5 years, October and March average polar cloud fraction has increased by about 7 \% and 10 \%, respectively, as year average sea ice extent has decreased by 5 \%?7 \%. The observed cloud changes are likely due to a number of effects including, but not limited to, the observed decrease in sea ice extent and thickness. Increasing cloud amount and changes in vertical distribution and optical properties have the potential to affect the radiative balance of the Arctic region by decreasing both the upwelling terrestrial longwave radiation and the downward shortwave solar radiation. Because longwave radiation dominates in the long polar winter, the overall effect of increasing low cloud cover is likely a warming of the Arctic and thus a positive climate feedback, possibly accelerating the melting of Arctic sea ice.},

  abstract  = {Recent declines in Arctic sea ice extent provide new opportunities to assess cloud influence on and response to seasonal sea ice loss. This study combines unique satellite observations with complementary data sets to document Arctic cloud and atmospheric structure during summer and early fall. The analysis focuses on 2006?2008, a period over which ice extent plummeted to record levels, substantial variability in atmospheric circulation patterns occurred, and spaceborne radar and lidar observations of vertical cloud structure became available. The observations show that large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, near-surface static stability, and surface conditions control Arctic cloud cover during the melt season. While no summer cloud response to sea ice loss was found, low clouds did form over newly open water during early fall. This seasonal variation in the cloud response to sea ice loss can be explained by near-surface static stability and air-sea temperature gradients. During summer, temperature inversions and weak air-sea temperature gradients limit atmosphere-ocean coupling. In contrast, relatively low static stability and strong air-sea gradients during early fall permit upward turbulent fluxes of moisture and heat and increased low cloud formation over newly open water. Because of their seasonal timing, cloud changes resulting from sea ice loss play a minor role in regulating ice-albedo feedbacks during summer, but may contribute to a cloud-ice feedback during early fall.},

  abstract  = {Downwelling radiation in six regional models from the Arctic Regional Climate Model Intercomparison (ARCMIP) project is systematically biased negative in comparison with observations from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment, although the correlations with observations are relatively good. In this paper, links between model errors and the representation of clouds in these models are investigated. Although some modeled cloud properties, such as the cloud water paths, are reasonable in a climatological sense, the temporal correlation of model cloud properties with observations is poor. The vertical distribution of cloud water is distinctly different among the different models; some common features also appear. Most models underestimate the presence of high clouds, and, although the observed preference for low clouds in the Arctic is present in most of the models, the modeled low clouds are too thin and are displaced downward. Practically all models show a preference to locate the lowest cloud base at the lowest model grid point. In some models this happens also to be where the observations show the highest occurrence of the lowest cloud base; it is not possible to determine if this result is just a coincidence. Different factors contribute to model surface radiation errors. For longwave radiation in summer, a negative bias is present both for cloudy and clear conditions, and intermodel differences are smaller when clouds are present. There is a clear relationship between errors in cloud-base temperature and radiation errors. In winter, in contrast, clear-sky cases are modeled reasonably well, but cloudy cases show a very large intermodel scatter with a significant bias in all models. This bias likely results from a complete failure in all of the models to retain liquid water in cold winter clouds. All models overestimate the cloud attenuation of summer solar radiation for thin and intermediate clouds, and some models maintain this behavior also for thick clouds.},

The main goal consists in the development of a turbulence closure for a microscale atmospheric model resolving the integrated effect of plumes emanated from leads, but not the individual convective eddies. To this end, 10 runs are carried out with a large eddy simulation (LES) model simulating the flow over leads for springtime atmospheric conditions with near-neutral inflow and a strong capping inversion. It is found that leads contribute to the stabilizing of the polar atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and that strong countergradient fluxes of heat exist outside a core region of the plumes. These findings form the basis for the development of the new closure. It uses a new scaling with the internal ABL height and the characteristic vertical velocity for the plume region as the main governing parameters. Results of a microscale model obtained with the new closure agree well with the LES for variable meteorological forcing in case of lead orthogonal flow and for a fixed ABL height and lead width. The good agreement concerns especially the plume inclination, temperature, and heat fluxes as well as the relative contributions of gradient and countergradient transport of heat. A future more general closure should account, for example, for variable lead widths and wind directions. Results of the microscale model could be used to derive a future parameterization of the lead effect in large-scale models.},

It is found that cloud cover variability near the sea ice margins is strongly linked to sea ice variability. Sea ice retreat is linked to a decrease in low-level cloud amount and a simultaneous increase in midlevel clouds. This pattern is apparent in both data sources. Changes in cloud cover can be explained by changes in the atmospheric temperature structure and an increase in near-surface temperatures resulting from the removal of sea ice. The subsequent decrease in static stability and deepening of the atmospheric boundary layer apparently contribute to the rise in cloud level. The radiative effect of this change is relatively small, as the direct radiative effects of cloud cover changes are compensated for by changes in the temperature and humidity profiles associated with varying ice conditions.},

The clearer skies led to downwelling shortwave (longwave) radiative fluxes increases of +32 Wm �2 (�4 Wm �2 ) from 2006 to 2007. Over three months, simple calculations show that these radiation differences alone could enhance surface ice melt by 0.3 m, or warm the surface ocean by 2.4 K, which enhances basal ice melt. Increased air temperatures and decreased relative humidity associated with an anticyclonic atmospheric circulation pattern explain the reduced cloudiness. Longer-term observations show that the 2007 cloudiness is anomalous in the recent past, but is not unprecedented.

Mixed-phase clouds occurred 41 \% of the time and were most frequent in the spring and fall transition seasons. These clouds often consisted of a shallow, cloud-top liquid layer from which ice particles formed and fell, although deep, multilayered mixed-phase cloud scenes were also observed. On average, individual cloud layers persisted for 12 h, while some mixed-phase cloud systems lasted for many days. Ninety percent of the observed mixed-phase clouds were 0.5?3 km thick, had a cloud base of 0?2 km, and resided at a temperature of 25�to 5�C. Under the assumption that the relatively large ice crystals dominate the radar signal, ice properties were retrieved from these clouds using radar reflectivity measurements. The annual average ice particle mean diameter, ice water content, and ice water path were 93 m, 0.027 g m 3 , and 42 g m 2 , respectively. These values are all larger than those found in single-phase ice clouds at SHEBA. Vertically resolved cloud liquid properties were not retrieved; however, the annual average, microwave radiometer?derived liquid water path (LWP) in mixed-phase clouds was 61 g m 2 . This value is larger than the average LWP observed in single-phase liquid clouds because the liquid water layers in the mixed-phase clouds tended to be thicker than those in all-liquid clouds. Although mixed-phase clouds were observed down to temperatures of about 40�C, the liquid fraction (ratio of LWP to total condensed water path) increased on average from zero at 24�C to one at 14�C. The observations show a range of 25�C at any given liquid fraction and a phase transition relationship that may change moderately with season.},

The properties derived under these transformations are general and apply to all scattering mechanisms in a given symmetrical configuration. The scattering coefficients calculated from theoretical models for layer random media and rough surfaces are shown to obey the derived symmetry relations. Use of symmetry properties in remote sensing of structural and environmental responses of scattering media is discussed.

In high latitudes, these cloud radiative effects have a crucial impact on the surface energy budget and thus on the evolution of the ice cover. For a springtime low-level mixed-phase stratiform cloud case from Barrow, Alaska, a unique combination of instruments and retrieval methods is combined with multiple modeling perspectives to determine key processes that control cloud phase partitioning. The interplay of local cloud-scale versus large-scale processes is considered. Rapid changes in phase partitioning were found to be caused by several main factors. Major influences were the large-scale advection of different air masses with different aerosol concentrations and humidity content, cloud-scale processes such as a change in the thermodynamical coupling state, and local-scale dynamics influencing the residence time of ice particles. Other factors such as radiative shielding by a cirrus and the influence of the solar cycle were found to only play a minor role for the specific case study (11–12 March 2013). For an even better understanding of cloud phase transitions, observations of key aerosol parameters such as profiles of cloud condensation nucleus and ice nucleus concentration are desirable.},

This study re-examines simple models for the effects due to finite beam-width and vertical shear of the horizontal wind. Analytic solutions of 1- and 2-dimensional models are presented. Comparisons of the simple 2-dimensional model with numerical integrations of a 3-dimensional model with a symmetrical Gaussian beam show that the 2-dimensional model is usually adequate. The solution of the 2-dimensional model gives a formula that can be applied easily to large data sets. Analysis of the analytic solutions of the 2-dimensional model for off-vertical beams reveals a term that has not been included in mathematical formulas for spectral broadening in the past. This term arises from the simultaneous effects of the changing geometry due to curvature within a finite beamwidth and the vertical wind shear. The magnitude of this effect can be comparable to that of the well-known effects of beam-broadening and wind shear, and since it can have either algebraic sign, it can significantly reduce (or increase) the expected spectral broadening, although under typical conditions it is smaller than the beam-broadening effect. The predictions of this simple model are found to be consistent with observations from the VHP radar at White Sands Missile Range, NM.},

with a review of the literature on Arctic vessel traffic to assess the potential effects of various stressors related to

region becomes more navigable and vessel traffic increases. The proposed vessel routes for the Arctic Ocean are
meant to serve as a starting point for further discussions before the region becomes fully navigable. As additional

Contemporary warm Arctic temperatures and large sea ice deficits (75% volume loss) demonstrate climate states outside of previous experience. Modeled changes of the Arctic cryosphere demonstrate that even limiting global temperature increases to near 2 °C will leave the Arctic a much different environment by mid-century with less snow and sea ice, melted permafrost, altered ecosystems, and a projected annual mean Arctic temperature increase of +4 °C. Second, even under ambitious emission reduction scenarios, high-latitude land ice melt, including Greenland, are foreseen to continue due to internal lags, leading to accelerating global sea level rise throughout the century. Third, future Arctic changes may in turn impact lower latitudes through tundra greenhouse gas release and shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation. Arctic-specific radiative and heat storage feedbacks may become an obstacle to achieving a stabilized global climate.

  abstract  = {Quantifying snowfall intensity especially under arctic conditions is a challenge because wind and snow drift deteriorate estimates obtained from both ground-based gauges and disdrometers. Ground-based remote sensing with active instruments might be a solution because they can measure well above drifting snow and do not suffer from flow distortions by the instrument. Clear disadvantages are, however, the dependency of e.g. radar returns on snow habit which might lead to similar large uncertainties. Moreover, high sensitivity radars are still far too costly to operate in a network and under harsh conditions. In this paper we compare returns from a low-cost, low-power vertically pointing FM-CW radar (Micro Rain Radar, MRR) operating at 24.1 GHz with returns from a 35.5 GHz cloud radar (MIRA36) for dry snowfall during a 6-month observation period at an Alpine station (Environmental Research Station Schneefernerhaus, UFS) at 2,650 m height above sea level. The goal was to quantify the potential and limitations of the MRR in relation to what is achievable by a cloud radar. The operational MRR procedures to derive standard radar variables like effective reflectivity factor (Z e) or the mean Doppler velocity (W) had to be modified for snowfall since the MRR was originally designed for rain observations. Since the radar returns from snowfall are weaker than from comparable rainfall, the behavior of the MRR close to its detection threshold has been analyzed and a method is proposed to quantify the noise level of the MRR based on clear sky observations. By converting the resulting MRR-Z e into 35.5 GHz equivalent Z e values, a remaining difference below 1 dBz with slightly higher values close to the noise threshold could be obtained. Due to the much higher sensitivity of MIRA36, the transition of the MRR from the true signal to noise can be observed, which agrees well with the independent clear sky noise estimate. The mean Doppler velocity differences between both radars are below 0.3 ms−1. The distribution of Z e values from MIRA36 are finally used to estimate the uncertainty of retrieved snowfall and snow accumulation with the MRR. At UFS low snowfall rates missed by the MRR are negligible when comparing snow accumulation, which were mainly caused by intensities between 0.1 and 0.8 mm h−1. The MRR overestimates the total snow accumulation by about 7%. This error is much smaller than the error caused by uncertain Z e–snowfall rate relations, which would affect the MIRA36 estimated to a similar degree.},

Results from two instrument systems, one comprising a vertical array of four turbulence-measuring instrument clusters, the other an automated, loose-tethered microstructure profiler, show that forcing by modest surface fluxes (surface friction velocity u.0 -   0.7 cm s -• surface buoyancy flux (w'b')o • -0.7 x  10 -7 W kg -•) substantially changes the scales and character of boundary layer turbulence relative to forcing by stress alone. Despite continuous freezing at the surface a diurnal cycle of heating and cooling of the mixed layer was seen, with downward oceanic heat flux as high as 70 W m -2 observed at middepth in the mixed layer near solar noon. Heat flux was determined both by direct eddy covariance of temperature and vertical velocity at fixed levels and from TKE and thermal dissipation estimates from the profiling instrument, with reasonable agreement. Similarly, there was close correspondence between TKE dissipation estimates obtained from inertial subrange spectral levels at the fixed instruments and from microstructure shear profiles. TKE production was dominated by buoyancy flux through most of the boundary layer. Thermal and saline eddy diffusivities were computed from directly measured fluxes and mixed layer temperature and salinity gradients, with mean values of 0.046 and 0.049 m 2 s -1 for temperature and salinity, respectively. Kolmogorov constants for relating thermal and saline dissipations to inertial subrange spectral levels were found to be 0.9 and 1.0, respectively, but with large scatter.},

  abstract  = {This paper synthesizes a variety of atmospheric and oceanic data to examine the large‐scale energy budget of the Arctic. Assessment of the atmospheric budget relies primarily on the ERA‐40 reanalysis. The seasonal cycles of vertically integrated atmospheric energy storage and the convergence of energy transport from ERA‐40, as evaluated for the polar cap (defined by the 70°N latitude circle), in general compare well with realizations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis over the period 1979–2001. However, shortcomings in top of atmosphere radiation, as compared to satellite data, and the net surface flux, contribute to large energy budget residuals in ERA‐40. The seasonal cycle of atmospheric energy storage is strongly modulated by the net surface flux, which is also the primary driver of seasonal changes in heat storage within the Arctic Ocean. Averaged for an Arctic Ocean domain, the July net surface flux from ERA-40 of −100 W m−2 (i.e., into the ocean), associated with sea ice melt and oceanic sensible heat gain, exceeds the atmospheric energy transport convergence of 91 W m−2. During winter (for which budget residuals are large), oceanic sensible heat loss and sea ice growth yield an upward surface flux of 50–60 W m−2, complemented with an atmospheric energy convergence of 80–90 W m−2 to provide a net radiation loss to space of 175–180 W m−2.},

  abstract  = {A consortium of polar scientists combined observational forces in a field campaign of unprecedented complexity to uncover the secrets of clouds and their role in Arctic amplification. Two research aircraft, an icebreaker research vessel, an ice-floe camp including an instrumented tethered balloon, and a permanent ground-based measurement station were employed in this endeavour.
Clouds play an important role in Arctic amplification. This term represents the recently observed enhanced warming of the Arctic relative to the global increase of near-surface air temperature. However, there are still important knowledge gaps regarding the interplay between Arctic clouds and aerosol particles, surface properties, as well as turbulent and radiative fluxes that inhibit accurate model simulations of clouds in the Arctic climate system. In an attempt to resolve this so-called Arctic cloud puzzle, two comprehensive and closely coordinated field studies were conducted: the ”Arctic CLoud Observations Using airborne measurements during polar Day (ACLOUD)” aircraft campaign, and the ”Physical feedbacks of Arctic boundary layer, Sea ice, Cloud and AerosoL (PASCAL)” ice breaker expedition. Both observational studies were performed in the framework of the German ”ArctiC Amplification:Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3” project. They took place in the vicinity of Svalbard (Norway) in May and June 2017. ACLOUD and PASCAL explored four pieces of the Arctic cloud puzzle: Cloud properties, aerosol impact on clouds, atmospheric radiation, and turbulent-dynamical processes. The two instrumented Polar 5 and Polar 6 aircraft, the icebreaker research vessel (RV) Polarstern, an ice-floe camp including an instrumented tethered balloon, and the permanent, ground-based measurement station at Ny-Ålesund (Svalbard) were employed to observe Arctic low and mid-level, mixed-phase clouds, and to investigate related atmospheric and surface processes. The Polar 5 aircraft served as a remote sensing observatory examining the clouds from above by downward-looking sensors; the Polar 6 aircraft operated as a flying in-situ measurement laboratory sampling inside and below the clouds. Most of the collocated Polar 5/6 flights were conducted either above RV Polarstern or over the Ny-Ålesund station, both of which monitored the clouds from below using similar but upward-looking remote sensing techniques as the Polar 5 aircraft. Several of the flights were carried out underneath collocated satellite tracks. The paper motivates the scientific objectives of the ACLOUD/PASCAL observations and describes the measured quantities, retrieved parameters, and the applied complementary instrumentation. Furthermore, it discusses selected measurement results, and poses critical research questions to be answered in future papers analyzing the data from the two field campaigns.},

  abstract  = {Polar cloud radiative forcing plays a crucial role in the determination of the surface and atmospheric energy balance through processes which are not yet fully understood. While there is a broad and fairly complete database of cloud measurements from several Arctic sites and field campaigns through the past two decades, the recent one‐year long U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE) field campaign at McMurdo Station has provided a hitherto unmatched multiple‐instrument set of ground‐based Antarctic cloud measurements. These observations are processed and used to derive the main cloud and liquid containing layer properties: occurrence fraction, cloud persistence and boundaries, and configuration relative to temperature and moisture inversions. The results are compared to previous Arctic observations. It is concluded that clouds and liquid‐bearing layers over McMurdo Station are essentially less prevalent and persistent than their Arctic counterparts. However, they typically have higher bases and show a weaker temperature dependence than in the Arctic, suggesting a more “pristine” Antarctic atmosphere. In addition, the clouds (including both water phases) typically extend toward relatively lower altitudes, and their relation to inversions near cloud top is often similar to those observed in the Arctic.},

  abstract = {The Microwave Radar/radiometer for Arctic Clouds (MiRAC) is a novel instrument package developed to study
the vertical structure and characteristics of clouds and precipitation onboard the Polar 5 research aircraft. MiRAC combines
a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar at 94 GHz including a 89 GHz passive channel (MiRAC-A) and an
eight channel radiometer with frequencies between 175 and 340 GHz (MiRAC-P). The radar can be flexibly operated using
5 different chirp sequences to provide measurements of the equivalent radar reflectivity with different vertical resolution down to
5 m. MiRAC is mounted for down-looking geometry on Polar 5 to enable the synergy with lidar and radiation measurements.
To mitigate the influence of the strong surface backscatter the radar is mounted with an inclination of about 25◦ backward
in a belly pod under the Polar 5 aircraft. Procedures for filtering ground return and range side-lobes have been developed.
MiRAC-P frequencies are especially adopted for low humidity conditions typical for the Arctic to provide information on
10 water vapor and hydrometeor content. MiRAC has been operated on 19 research flights during the ACLOUD campaign in the
vicinity of Svalbard in May/June 2017 providing in total 48 hours of measurements from flight altitudes > 2300 m. The radar
measurements have been carefully quality controlled and corrected for surface clutter, mounting of the instrument, and aircraft
orientation to provide measurements on a unified, geo-referenced vertical grid allowing the combination with the other nadir
pointing instruments. An intercomparison with CloudSat shows good agreement in terms of cloud top height of 1.5 km and
15 radar reflectivity up to -5 dBz and demonstrates that MiRAC is able to fill the gap in observing low level clouds with its more
than ten times higher vertical resolution down to about 150 m above the surface. This is especially important for the Arctic as
about 45 % of the clouds during ACLOUD showed cloud tops below 1200 m, i.e., the blind zone of CloudSat.},

Warm rain is very infrequent over the continents, with significant warm rain found only in onshore flow in the tropics, and over India, China, and Indochina. Comparison of the properties of precipitating and nonprecipitating warm clouds shows that the scarcity of warm rain over land can be explained by smaller effective radii in continental clouds that delay the onset of precipitation. The results highlight the importance of ice-phase processes for the global hydrological cycle and may lead to an improved parameterization of precipitation in general circulation models.},

However, such processes are still not clearly understood although they are important processes for precipitation formation in midlatitudes. To better understand how ice particles grow within such clouds, changes in the microphysical parameters of a particle population falling through the cloud have to be analyzed. The Transportable Atmospheric Radar (TARA) can retrieve the full 3D Doppler velocity vector based on a unique three-beam configuration. Using the derived wind information, a new fall streak retrieval technique is proposed so that microphysical changes along those streaks can be studied. The method is based on Doppler measurements only. The shown examples measured during the Analysis of the Composition of Clouds with Extended Polarization Techniques (ACCEPT) campaign demonstrate that the retrieval is able to capture the fall streaks within different cloud systems. These fall streaks can be used to study changes in a single particle population from its generation (at cloud top) until its disintegration. In this study fall streaks are analyzed using radar moments or Doppler spectra. Synergetic measurements with other instruments during ACCEPT allow the detection of liquid layers within the clouds. The estimated microphysical information is used here to get a better understanding of the influence of supercooled liquid layers on ice crystal growth. This technique offers a new perspective for cloud microphysical studies.},

  abstract = {The three-dimensional structure of clouds is known to be important for determining their radiative effects,but it is difficult to obtain this structure directly from observations. In this paper a stochastic model is describedthat is capable of simulating the structural properties unique to cirrus: fallstreak geometry and shear-inducedmixing. We first present an analysis of time–height cloud radar sections from southern England to extract the cirrusparameters of interest. It is found that horizontal power spectra of the logarithm of ice-water content (estimatedfrom radar reflectivity factor and temperature) typically exhibit a spectral slope of around−5/3 near cloud topthat decreases with depth into the cloud, to values as low as−3.5 in some cases. This decrease can be explainedby wind shear coupled with a spread of particle fall speeds leading to a homogenization that acts preferentially atsmaller scales. The power spectra exhibit a distinct scale break, becoming flat at scales larger than around 50 km(the ‘outer scale’). The orientation of the fallstreaks may be predicted from the profile of mean wind and mean icefall speed. We then describe the stochastic model, which takes as input profiles of the mean and fractional standarddeviation of ice-water content, spectral slope, outer scale and wind speed. It first generates an isotropic 3-D fractalfield by performing an inverse 3-D Fourier transform on a matrix of simulated Fourier coefficients with amplitudesconsistent with the observed 1-D spectra. Random phases forthe coefficients allow multiple realizations of a cloudwith the same statistical properties to be generated. Then horizontal slices from the domain are manipulated inturn to simulate horizontal displacement and changes to the spectra with height. Finally the field is scaled toproduce the observed mean and fractional standard deviation of ice-water content. Vertical 2-D slices extractedfrom the domain are very similar in appearance to cloud radar observations. Radiative-transfer calculations usingthe independent column approximation are used to show that the different fallstreak orientation resulting fromdifferent wind shears can change mean top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes by in excess of 45 W m−2in the short-waveand15Wm−2in the long-wave. The effect of wind shear to induce horizontal mixingcauses an additionalbut smaller radiative effect. We also investigate the biases that would be expected from the assumptions made inthe radiation schemes of general-circulation models (GCMs). It is found that there is some compensation betweenthe errors arising from the assumptions of horizontal homogeneity and maximum-random overlap; if a GCM wereto improve the overlap assumption but still assume cloudsto be horizontally homogeneous then the total error incloud radiative effect would be likely to increase.},

  abstract = {Abstract Absolute calibration of cloud radars is very difficult. A new method is proposed for 94/95-GHz radars that exploits the fact that at this frequency, the radar reflectivity factor of rain measured at a range of 250 m is approximately constant at 19 dBZ for rain rates between 3 and 10 mm h–1, due to the combined effects of extinction and non-Rayleigh scattering. The standard deviation of around 1.5 dB is due to natural variations in the number concentration of drops and is consistent with the variation predicted from theory, but averaging over a number of different rain events over a month or more should be sufficient to reduce the calibration error to less than 1 dB. A thin layer of rainwater on the radomes of the 94-GHz radar at Chilbolton, in southern England, was found to cause a two-way attenuation of between 9 and 14 dB, but it is shown here that the technique may be successfully implemented by operating the radar at a low elevation angle and employing a shelter to keep it dry. Most 94-GHz cloud radars worldwide use the same amplifier, and monitoring the calibration of this radar over a 2-yr period of continuous use reveals a loss of power of around 1 dB in the first year and 10 dB in the second. Frequent calibration is therefore recommended.},

  abstract = {The number concentration of cloud particles is a key quantity for understanding aerosol–cloud interactions and describing clouds in climate and numerical weather prediction models. In contrast with recent advances for liquid clouds, few observational constraints exist regarding the ice crystal number concentration (Ni). This study investigates how combined lidar–radar measurements can be used to provide satellite estimates of Ni, using a methodology that constrains moments of a parameterized particle size distribution (PSD). The operational liDAR–raDAR (DARDAR) product serves as an existing base for this method, which focuses on ice clouds with temperatures Tc<−30C.
Theoretical considerations demonstrate the capability for accurate retrievals of Ni, apart from a possible bias in the concentration in small crystals when Tc>−50 ∘C, due to the assumption of a monomodal PSD shape in the current method. This is verified via a comparison of satellite estimates to coincident in situ measurements, which additionally demonstrates the sufficient sensitivity of lidar–radar observations to Ni. Following these results, satellite estimates of Ni are evaluated in the context of a case study and a preliminary climatological analysis based on 10 years of global data. Despite a lack of other large-scale references, this evaluation shows a reasonable physical consistency in Ni spatial distribution patterns. Notably, increases in Ni are found towards cold temperatures and, more significantly, in the presence of strong updrafts, such as those related to convective or orographic uplifts. Further evaluation and improvement of this method are necessary, although these results already constitute a first encouraging step towards large-scale observational constraints for Ni. Part 2 of this series uses this new dataset to examine the controls on Ni.},

Due to sparse in situ measurements of ice cloud properties, the controls on the Ni have remained difficult to determine. As more advanced treatments of ice clouds are included in global models, it is becoming increasingly necessary to develop strong observational constraints on the processes involved. This work uses the DARDAR-Nice Ni retrieval described in Part 1 to investigate the controls on the Ni at a global scale. The retrieved clouds are separated by type. The effects of temperature, proxies for in-cloud updraft and aerosol concentrations are investigated. Variations in the cloud top Ni (Ni(top)) consistent with both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation are observed along with differing relationships between aerosol and Ni(top) depending on the prevailing meteorological situation and aerosol type. Away from the cloud top, the Ni displays a different sensitivity to these controlling factors, providing a possible explanation for the low Ni sensitivity to temperature and ice nucleating particles (INP) observed in previous in situ studies. This satellite dataset provides a new way of investigating the response of cloud properties to meteorological and aerosol controls. The results presented in this work increase our confidence in the retrieved Ni and will form the basis for further study into the processes influencing ice and mixed phase clouds.},

By using thresholds obtained from multiyear, multisite EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network) measurements, four aerosol classes (small; large, spherical; large, non-spherical; mixed, partly non-spherical) and several cloud classes (liquid, ice) are defined. Thus, particles are classified by their physical features (shape and size) instead of by source. The methodology is applied to 2 months of continuous observations (24h a day, 7 days a week) with the multiwavelength-Raman-polarization lidar PollyXT during the High-Definition Clouds and Precipitation for advancing Climate Prediction (HD(CP)2) Observational Prototype Experiment (HOPE) in spring 2013. Cloudnet equipment was operated continuously directly next to the lidar and is used for comparison. By discussing three 24h case studies, it is shown that the aerosol discrimination is very feasible and informative and gives a good complement to the Cloudnet target categorization. Performing the categorization for the 2-month data set of the entire HOPE campaign, almost 1 million pixel (5min  ×  30m) could be analysed with the newly developed tool. We find that the majority of the aerosol trapped in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) was composed of small particles as expected for a heavily populated and industrialized area. Large, spherical aerosol was observed mostly at the top of the PBL and close to the identified cloud bases, indicating the importance of hygroscopic growth of the particles at high relative humidity. Interestingly, it is found that on several days non-spherical particles were dispersed from the ground into the atmosphere.},

Executive Summary

Clouds and aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty to estimates and interpretations of the Earth's changing energy budget. This chapter focuses on process understanding and considers observations, theory and models to assess how clouds and aerosols contribute and respond to climate change. The following conclusions are drawn.

Progress in Understanding

Many of the cloudiness and humidity changes simulated by climate models in warmer climates are now understood as responses to large-scale circulation changes that do not appear to depend strongly on sub-grid scale model processes, increasing confidence in these changes. For example, multiple lines of evidence now indicate positive feedback contributions from circulation-driven changes in both the height of high clouds and the latitudinal distribution of clouds (medium to high confidence). However, some aspects of the overall cloud response vary substantially among models, and these appear to depend strongly on sub-grid scale processes in which there is less confidence. {7.2.4, 7.2.5, 7.2.6, Figure 7.11}

Climate-relevant aerosol processes are better understood, and climate-relevant aerosol properties better observed, than at the time of AR4. However, the representation of relevant processes varies greatly in global aerosol and climate models and it remains unclear what level of sophistication is required to model their effect on climate. Globally, between 20 and 40% of aerosol optical depth (medium confidence) and between one quarter and two thirds of cloud condensation nucleus concentrations (low confidence) are of anthropogenic origin.},

  abstract = {Radiative parametrizations for both ice and water clouds are developed in terms of liquid/ice water content, based on Mie scattering theory. For ice crystals the application of Mie theory is guided by the hexagonal-crystal/equivalent-spheres comparison of Takano and Liou. These parametrizations are extensively tested against measurements from aircraft and are shown to perform satisfactorily, although corrections for unobserved small crystals and the effect of crystal shape are large and not currently well defined. The parametrizations are then used to investigate the effect of mixed-phase clouds on radiative transfer. It is found that, because the radiative properties of ice crystals and liquid droplets are significantly different, the radiative properties of mixed-phase clouds cannot be simulated successfully if the ice in clouds is converted into liquid water. Both the albedo and the rate of change of albedo with ice fraction are significantly dependent on the method by which the phases are mixed; these factors may be of especial importance in climate-sensitivity experiments that incorporate mixed-phase clouds. The presence of ice in clouds below the cirrus level is often ignored in climate-model and radiation-budget studies. The calculations presented here indicate that this neglect may lead to a serious bias in cloud albedo for a given path of condensed water.},

Large variability in cloud cover and properties and the therefore low signal-to-noise ratio for aerosol-induced perturbations hamper the identification of effects in observations. Six approaches are discussed as a means to isolate the impact of anthropogenic aerosol on clouds from natural cloud variability to estimate or constrain the effective forcing. These are (i) intentional cloud modification, (ii) ship tracks, (iii) differences between the hemispheres, (iv) trace gases, (v) weekly cycles and (vi) trends. Ship track analysis is recommendable for detailed process understanding, and the analysis of weekly cycles and long-term trends is most promising to derive estimates or constraints on the effective radiative forcing.},

  abstract = {he Arctic region is particularly sensitive to climate change. Mixed-phase clouds, comprising both ice and supercooled liquid water, have a large impact on radiative fluxes in the Arctic. These clouds occur frequently during all seasons in the region, where they often persist for many days at a time. This persistence is remarkable given the inherent instability of ice–liquid mixtures. In recent years it has emerged that feedbacks between numerous local processes, including the formation and growth of ice and cloud droplets, radiative cooling, turbulence, entrainment and surface fluxes of heat and moisture, interact to create a resilient mixed-phase cloud system. As well as the persistent mixed-phase cloud state there is another distinct Arctic state, characterized by radiatively clear conditions. The occurrence of either state seems to be related, in part, to large-scale environmental conditions. We suggest that shifts in the large-scale environment could alter the prevalence of mixed-phase clouds, potentially affecting surface radiative fluxes and the Arctic energy budget.},

The rationale underpinning the method consists in exploiting the peculiar features observed in Doppler spectra caused by the wavelength dependence of scattering and absorption properties. A notional study based on a large data set of DSDs measured by a two-dimensional video disdrometer demonstrates that the retrieval performs best for small/moderate air broadening spectral width and when mean volume diameters exceed at least 1 mm. The retrieval is also limited to ranges below cloud base and where the signal-to-noise ratio of both radars exceed 10 dB, which rules out regions affected by strong attenuation. Broadly speaking, it is applicable to rain rates comprised between roughly 1 and 30 mm h−1. Preliminary retrieval for observations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site shows very good agreement with independent reflectivity measurements from a 0.915 GHz wind profiler. The proposed methodology shows great potential in linking microphysics to dynamics in rainfall studies.},

Cloud radar observations contain information on multiple particle species, when there are distinct peaks in the Doppler spectrum.

Using this tree data structure to represent the peaks of a Doppler spectrum it is possible to drop all a-priori assumptions on the number and arrangement of subpeaks. The approach is rigid, unambiguous and can provide a basis for advanced analysis methods. The applicability is briefly demonstrated in a case study, where the tree structure was used to separate two particle populations in an Arctic multi-layered mixed-phase cloud, which was observed during the research vessel Polarstern expedition PS106.},

  abstract = {Abstract CloudSat's 94-GHz Cloud Profiling Radar provides unique near-global observations of precipitation frequency and intensity. Here CloudSat-based diagnostics for near-surface precipitation frequency are implemented in publicly available software that is widely used for climate model evaluation. The new diagnostics are “definition aware” and “scale aware.” As a result, the diagnostics enable robust assessment of modeled near-surface precipitation frequency at a range of intensity classes. The new diagnostics are used to evaluate precipitation frequency in a state-of-the-art climate model, the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). CESM1 rains and snows too frequently, a bias that is especially pronounced for light rain. Conversely, while rare in both observations and CESM1, the heaviest rainfall events occur too infrequently in CESM1. Though the spatial distribution of snowfall events matches observations well, CESM1 also exhibits excessive snow frequency biases. Despite these biases, projected CESM1 changes in reflectivity-based diagnostics provide interesting insights into what a future 94-GHz radar could detect in a warmer world. With 3 °C of global warming, a future CloudSat-class mission would detect substantial conversion of snow to rain at midlatitudes, a narrowing of the Tropical Pacific rain belt, increased light rain in subtropics, and increased snow frequency in polar regions. The future CESM1 simulations also provide evidence that present-day spatial and magnitude biases imprint themselves on precipitation frequency changes. In summary, new precipitation frequency diagnostics for a range of precipitation intensities robustly expose climate model biases and inform expectations for observable future precipitation changes in a warming world.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) with the new ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic atmosphere model (ICON) covering Germany are evaluated for four days in spring 2013 using observational data from various sources. Reference simulations with the established Consortium for Small-scale Modelling (COSMO) numerical weather prediction model and further standard LES codes are performed and used as a reference. This comprehensive evaluation approach covers multiple parameters and scales, focusing on boundary-layer variables, clouds and precipitation. The evaluation points to the need to work on parametrizations influencing the surface energy balance, and possibly on ice cloud microphysics. The central purpose for the development and application of ICON in the LES configuration is the use of simulation results to improve the understanding of moist processes, as well as their parametrization in climate models. The evaluation thus aims at building confidence in the model's ability to simulate small- to mesoscale variability in turbulence, clouds and precipitation. The results are encouraging: the high-resolution model matches the observed variability much better at small- to mesoscales than the coarser resolved reference model. In its highest grid resolution, the simulated turbulence profiles are realistic and column water vapour matches the observed temporal variability at short time-scales. Despite being somewhat too large and too frequent, small cumulus clouds are well represented in comparison with satellite data, as is the shape of the cloud size spectrum. Variability of cloud water matches the satellite observations much better in ICON than in the reference model. In this sense, it is concluded that the model is fit for the purpose of using its output for parametrization development, despite the potential to improve further some important aspects of processes that are also parametrized in the high-resolution model.},

Here, the authors use a spectral radar simulator to develop a consistent dataset containing particle mass, area, and size distribution as functions of size. This is an essential prerequisite for radar sensitivity studies and retrieval development. The data are obtained from aircraft in situ and ground-based radar observations during the Indirect and Semi-Direct Aerosol Campaign (ISDAC) campaign in Alaska. The two main results of this study are as follows: 1) An improved method to estimate the particle mass–size relation as a function of temperature is developed and successfully evaluated by combining aircraft in situ and radar observations. The method relies on a functional relation between reflectivity and Doppler velocity. 2) The impact on the Doppler spectrum by replacing measurements of particle area and size distribution by recent analytical expressions is investigated. For this, higher-order moments such as skewness and kurtosis as well as the slopes of the Doppler spectrum are also used as a proxy for the Doppler spectrum. For the area–size relation, it is found that a power law is not sufficient to describe particle area and small deviations from a power law are essential for obtaining consistent higher moments. For particle size distributions, the normalization approach for the gamma distribution of Testud et al., adapted to maximum diameter as size descriptor, is preferred.},

Active lidar and radar instruments on board CALIPSO and CloudSat allow the vertical distribution of clouds and their optical properties to be studied on a global scale. To evaluate the clouds modeled by ECHAM5 with CALIPSO and CloudSat, the lidar and radar satellite simulators of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project’s Observation Simulator Package are used. Comparison of ECHAM5 with CALIPSO and CloudSat found large-scale features resolved by the model, such as the Hadley circulation, are captured well. The lidar simulator demonstrated ECHAM5 overestimates the amount of high-level clouds, particularly optically thin clouds. High-altitude clouds in ECHAM5 consistently produced greater lidar scattering ratios compared with CALIPSO. Consequently, the lidar signal in ECHAM5 frequently attenuated high in the atmosphere. The large scattering ratios were due to an underestimation of effective ice crystal radii in ECHAM5. Doubling the effective ice crystal radii improved the scattering ratios and frequency of attenuation. Additionally, doubling the effective ice crystal radii improved the detection of ECHAM5’s highest-level clouds by the radar simulator, in better agreement with CloudSat. ECHAM5 was also shown to significantly underestimate midlevel clouds and (sub)tropical low-level clouds. The low-level clouds produced were consistently perceived by the lidar simulator as too optically thick. The radar simulator demonstrated ECHAM5 overestimates the frequency of precipitation, yet underestimates its intensity compared with CloudSat observations. These findings imply compensating mechanisms in ECHAM5 balance out the radiative imbalance caused by incorrect optical properties of clouds and consistently large hydrometeors in the atmosphere.},

Large differences in the heterogeneous freezing behavior in the mostly layered clouds are found. For example, <20\%, 30\%–40\% and around 70\% of the cloud layers with cloud top temperatures from −15°C to −20°C, showed ice formation over Punta Arenas, Stellenbosch, and Leipzig, respectively. The observed strong contrast reflects the differences in the free tropospheric aerosol conditions at northern midlatitudes, that are controlled by anthropogenic pollution, mineral dust, forest fire smoke, terrestrial biological material and high southern midlatitudes with clean marine conditions.},

These contamination sources can vary in space, time, and even in their basic characteristics. Human experts analyzing Doppler spectra can often identify the desired atmospheric signal among the contamination. However, it is quite difficult to build automated algorithms that can approach the skill of the human expert.

  volume   = {22},
  abstract = {A technique is described to retrieve stratocumulus liquid water content (LWC) using the differential attenuation measured by vertically pointing radars at 35 and 94 GHz. Millimeter-wave attenuation is proportional to LWC and increases with frequency, so LWC can be derived without the need to make any assumptions on the nature of the droplet size distribution. There is also no need for the radars to be well calibrated. A significant advantage over many radar techniques in stratocumulus is that the presence of drizzle drops (those with a diameter larger than around 50 μm) does not affect the retrieval, even though such drops may dominate the radar signal. It is important, however, that there are not significant numbers of drops larger than 600 μm, which scatter outside of the Rayleigh regime at 94 GHz. A lidar ceilometer is used to locate the cloud base in the presence of drizzle falling below the cloud. An accuracy of around 0.04 g m−3 is achievable with averaging over 1 min and 150 m (two range gates), but for the previously suggested frequency pair of 10 and 35 GHz, the corresponding accuracy would be considerably worse at 0.34 g m−3. First, the retrieval of LWC is simulated using aircraft-measured size spectra taken from a profile through marine stratocumulus. Results are then presented from two case studies—one using two cloud radars at Chilbolton in southern United Kingdom, and another using the Cloud Profiling Radar System at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site in Oklahoma. The liquid water path from the technique was found to be in good agreement with the values that were obtained from microwave radiometers, with the difference between the two being close to the accuracy of the radiometer retrieval. In the case of well-mixed stratocumulus, the profiles were close to adiabatic.},

  abstract = {Results are presented from a case study in which coincident 35- and 94-GHz radars located at Chilbolton, England, were used to measure crystal size in cirrus clouds. In the presence of larger crystals the 94-GHz radar scatters sufficiently beyond the Rayleigh regime that the difference in reflectivity factor measured by the two can be directly related to size. This enables more accurate estimation of ice water content than would be possible using a single radar. The small crystals at the top of the cloud scatter in the Rayleigh regime at both wavelengths, which provides a valuable method of calibration, but also means that sizing is not possible in this part of the cloud. Ice water content and median volume diameter were derived and compared with the analyses of the U.K. Meteorological Office Unified Model. The smallest measurable median volume diameter in this case study was around 200 μm, although it is believed that with both radars sensitive down to −35 dBZ, it should be possible to measure median diameters of 100 μm. Scattering calculations have been carried out to determine the sensitivity of these measurements to crystal density, crystal aspect ratio, and the shape of the size distribution. Density is found to be the most significant source of uncertainty, possibly introducing errors of 20\% into retrieved diameter.},

Using a vertically pointing Doppler X-band radar, cases can be separated into one of three groups: unrimed to lightly rimed, riming with no bimodal spectra and fall speeds greater than 2.0 m s−1, and riming with bimodal velocity spectra. By averaging polarimetric variables over a 20° by 10-km box near the X-band radar, different signatures were documented for each of the three groups. These polarimetric signatures were then compared with a simplified T-matrix scattering model. Differential reflectivity ZDR was the one polarimetric variable to consistently vary across all three groups. Unrimed to lightly rimed cases had profiles of polarimetric signatures similar to numerous previous studies. Riming cases without detectable bimodal spectra had ZDR values on the order of 0.2 dB lower than unrimed to lightly rimed cases, while cases with bimodal spectra had ZDR values about 0.2–0.4 dB higher than unrimed to lightly rimed cases. Both signatures were reproduced using populations of aggregates, dendrites, and needles in the T-matrix scattering model. While these signatures show the potential to identify riming, they are not enough larger than measurement biases and case-to-case variability to be confidently used without confirmation from other data sources, such as a vertically pointing radar.},

  abstract = {We have identified a region of an ice cloud where a sharp transition of dual-wavelength ratio occurs at a fixed height for longer than 20 min. In this paper we provide evidence that rapid aggregation of ice particles occurred in this region, creating large particles. This evidence comes from triple-wavelength Doppler spectrum radar data that were fortuitously being collected. Through quantitative comparison of the Doppler spectra from the three radars we are able to estimate the ice particle size distribution (of particles larger than 0.75 mm) at different heights in the cloud. This allows us to investigate the evolution of the ice particle size distribution and determine whether the evolution is consistent with aggregation, riming or vapour deposition. The newly developed method allows us to isolate the signal from the larger (non-Rayleigh scattering) particles in the distribution. Therefore, a particle size distribution retrieval is possible in areas of the cloud where the dual-wavelength ratio method would fail because the bulk dual-wavelength ratio value is too close to zero.
The ice particles grow rapidly from a maximum size of 0.75 to 5 mm while falling less than 500 m in under 10 min. This rapid growth is shown to agree well with theoretical estimates of aggregation, with aggregation efficiency being approximately 0.7, and is inconsistent with other growth processes, e.g. growth by vapour deposition or riming. The aggregation occurs in the middle of the cloud and is not present throughout the entire lifetime of the cloud. However, the layer of rapid aggregation is very well defined at a constant height, where the temperature is −15 ∘C and lasts for at least 20 min (approximate horizontal distance: 24 km). Immediately above this layer, the radar Doppler spectrum is bi-modal, which signals the formation of new small ice particles at that height. We suggest that these newly formed particles, at approximately −15 ∘C, grow dendritic arms, enabling them to easily interlock and accelerate the aggregation process. The large estimated aggregation efficiency in this cloud is consistent with recent laboratory studies for dendrites at this temperature.},

The aerosol number concentrations and size distributions were evaluated against observations, which shows satisfactory agreement in the magnitude and temporal variability of the main aerosol contributors to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. From the modelled aerosol number concentrations, number concentrations of CCN were calculated as a function of vertical velocity using a comprehensive aerosol activation scheme which takes into account the influence of aerosol chemical and physical properties on CCN formation. There is a large amount of spatial variability in aerosol concentrations; however the resulting CCN concentrations vary significantly less over the domain. Temporal variability is large in both aerosols and CCN. A parameterization of the CCN number concentrations is developed for use in models. The technique involves defining a number of best fit functions to capture the dependence of CCN on vertical velocity at different pressure levels. In this way, aerosol chemical and physical properties as well as thermodynamic conditions are taken into account in the new CCN parameterization. A comparison between the parameterization and the CCN estimates from the model data shows excellent agreement. This parameterization may be used in other regions and time periods with a similar aerosol load; furthermore, the technique demonstrated here may be employed in regions dominated by different aerosol species.},

While there are case studies supporting this, a climatological sense of the importance of dust to atmospheric ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations and its seasonal variability over Europe is lacking. Here, we use a mesoscale model to estimate Saharan dust concentrations over Europe in 2008. There are large differences in median dust concentrations between seasons, with the highest concentrations and highest variability in the lower to mid-troposphere. Laboratory-based ice nucleation parameterisations are applied to these simulated dust number concentrations to calculate the potential INP resulting from immersion freezing and deposition nucleation on these dust particles. The potential INP concentrations increase exponentially with height due to decreasing temperatures in the lower and mid-troposphere. When the ice-activated fraction increases sufficiently, INP concentrations follow the dust particle concentrations. The potential INP profiles exhibit similarly large differences between seasons, with the highest concentrations in spring (median potential immersion INP concentrations nearly 105 m−3, median potential deposition INP concentrations at 120% relative humidity with respect to ice over 105 m−3), about an order of magnitude larger than those in summer. Using these results, a best-fit function is provided to estimate the potential INPs for use in limited-area models, which is representative of the normal background INP concentrations over Europe. A statistical evaluation of the results against field and laboratory measurements indicates that the INP concentrations are in close agreement with observations.},

Above the melting level, in situ images and triple-frequency radar signatures both indicate the presence of moderately rimed aggregates. Various mass-size relationships of ice particles and snow scattering databases are used to compute the radar reflectivity from the in situ particle size distribution. At Ku and Ka band, the best agreement with radar observations is found when using the self-similar Rayleigh-Gans approximation for moderately rimed aggregates. At W band, a direct comparison is challenging because of the non-Rayleigh effects and of the probable attenuation due to ice aggregates and supercooled liquid water between the two aircraft. A variational method enables the retrieval of the full precipitation profile above and below the melting layer, by combining the observations from the three radars. Even with three radar frequencies, the retrieval of rain properties is challenging over land, where the integrated attenuation is not available. Otherwise, retrieved mean volume diameters and water contents of both solid and liquid precipitation are in agreement with in situ observations and indicate local changes of the degree of riming of ice aggregates, on the scale of 5 km. Finally, retrieval results are analyzed to explore the validity of using continuity constraints on the water mass flux and diameter within the melting layer in order to improve retrievals of ice properties.},

Since the number concentrations of all these hydrometeors are calculated explicitly, all relevant homogenous and heterogenous nucleation processes have been parameterized including the activation of cloud condensation nuclei, which is not predicted in most state-of-the-art cloud resolving models. Therefore the new scheme can discriminate between continental and maritime conditions and can be used for investigations of aerosol effects on the precipitation formation in mixed-phase clouds. In addition, the scheme includes turbulence effects on droplet coalescence, collisional breakup of raindrops and size-dependent collision efficiencies. A new general approximation of the collection kernels and the corresponding collision integrals is introduced.},

  abstract = {Abstract Ground-based observations of ice particle size distribution and ensemble mean density are used to quantify the effect of riming on snowfall. The rime mass fraction is derived from these measurements by following the approach that is used in a single ice-phase category microphysical scheme proposed for the use in numerical weather prediction models. One of the characteristics of the proposed scheme is that the prefactor of a power law relation that links mass and size of ice particles is determined by the rime mass fraction, while the exponent does not change. To derive the rime mass fraction, a mass-dimensional relation representative of unrimed snow is also determined. To check the validity of the proposed retrieval method, the derived rime mass fraction is converted to the effective liquid water path that is compared to microwave radiometer observations. Since dual-polarization radar observations are often used to detect riming, the impact of riming on dual-polarization radar variables is studied for differential reflectivity measurements. It is shown that the relation between rime mass fraction and differential reflectivity is ambiguous, other factors such as change in median volume diameter need also be considered. Given the current interest on sensitivity of precipitation to aerosol pollution, which could inhibit riming, the importance of riming for surface snow accumulation is investigated. It is found that riming is responsible for 5\% to 40\% of snowfall mass. The study is based on data collected at the University of Helsinki field station in Hyytiälä during U.S. Department of Energy Biogenic Aerosols Effects on Clouds and Climate (BAECC) field campaign and the winter 2014/2015. In total 22 winter storms were analyzed, and detailed analysis of two events is presented to illustrate the study.},

The measurements are taken from a cloud observatory recently established on the windward shore of Barbados. Cloud microphysical development is explored through an analysis of the radar echo of shallow cumuli before the development of active precipitation. The increase of reflectivity with height (Z gradient) depends on the amount of cloud water, which varies with meteorology, and cloud droplet number concentration N, which varies with the aerosol. Clouds with a large Z gradient have a higher tendency to form precipitation than clouds with a small Z gradient. Under similar meteorological conditions, the Z gradient is expected to be large in an environment with few aerosols and small in an environment with many aerosols. The aerosol environment is defined using three methods, but only one (based on the Raman lidar linear-depolarization ratio) to measure dusty conditions correlates significantly with the Z gradient. On average, nondusty days are characterized by a larger Z gradient. However, the dust concentration varies seasonally and covaries with relative humidity. Large-eddy simulations show that small changes in the relative humidity can have as much influence on the development of precipitation within the cloud layer as large changes in N. When clouds are conditioned on their ambient relative humidity, the sensitivity of the Z gradient to dust vanishes.},

  abstract = {Based on boundary layer theory and a comparison of empirical power laws relating the Reynolds and Best numbers, it was apparent that the primary variables governing a hydrometeor's terminal velocity were its mass, its area projected to the flow, and its maximum dimension. The dependence of terminal velocities on surface roughness appeared secondary, with surface roughness apparently changing significantly only during phase changes (i.e., ice to liquid). In the theoretical analysis, a new, comprehensive expression for the drag force, which is valid for both inertial and viscous-dominated flow, was derived. A hydrometeor's mass and projected area were simply and accurately represented in terms of its maximum dimension by using dimensional power laws. Hydrometeor terminal velocities were calculated by using mass- and area-dimensional power laws to parameterize the Best number, X. Using a theoretical relationship general for all particle types, the Reynolds number, Re, was then calculated from the Best number. Terminal velocities were calculated from Re. Alternatively, four Re–X power-law expressions were extracted from the theoretical Re–X relationship. These expressions collectively describe the terminal velocities of all ice particle types. These were parameterized using mass- and area-dimensional power laws, yielding four theoretically based power-law expressions predicting fall speeds in terms of ice particle maximum dimension. When parameterized for a given ice particle type, the theoretical fall speed power law can be compared directly with empirical fall speed-dimensional power laws in the literature for the appropriate Re range. This provides a means of comparing theory with observations. Terminal velocities predicted by this method were compared with fall speeds given by empirical fall speed expressions for the same ice particle type, which were curve fits to measured fall speeds. Such comparisons were done for nine types of ice particles. Fall speeds predicted by this method differed from those based on measurements by no more than 20\%. The features that distinguish this method of determining fall speeds from others are that it does not represent particles as spheroids, it is general for any ice particle shape and size, it is conceptually and mathematically simple, it appears accurate, and it provides for physical insight. This method also allows fall speeds to be determined from aircraft measurements of ice particle mass and projected area, rather than directly measuring fall speeds. This approach may be useful for ice crystals characterizing cirrus clouds, for which direct fall speed measurements are difficult.},

The other main modification was implemented in the snow parameterisation by replacing the constant intercept parameter to a temperature dependent intercept parameter. These microphysics modifications are evaluated in detail in three case studies (one stratiform and two convective cases) by comparing the modelled and observed reflectivity and precipitation data. Comparisons to weather radar reflectivity data show that especially light to moderate precipitation forecast (< 20 dB) is improved. For the evaluation of the modelled precipitation, weather radar and rain gauge data are combined in order to get spatially high resolution data of high accuracy. For the quality analysis, the new error measure SAL (analysis of structure, amplitude and location) is used.

The atmospheric state classification is informed about the large‐scale meteorology and state of cloudiness at the ARM SGP site by combining ECMWF ERA‐Interim reanalysis data with 14 years of continuous observations from the millimeter‐wavelength cloud radar. Almost half of the cirrus cloud occurrences in the vicinity of the ARM SGP site during SPARTICUS can be explained by three distinct synoptic conditions, namely, upper level ridges, midlatitude cyclones with frontal systems, and subtropical flows. Probability density functions (PDFs) of cirrus microphysical properties such as particle size distributions (PSDs), ice number concentrations, and ice water content (IWC) are examined and exhibit striking differences among the different synoptic regimes. Generally, narrower PSDs with lower IWC but higher ice number concentrations are found in cirrus sampled in upper level ridges, whereas cirrus sampled in subtropical flows, fronts, and aged anvils show broader PSDs with considerably lower ice number concentrations but higher IWC. Despite striking contrasts in the cirrus microphysics for different large‐scale environments, the PDFs of vertical velocity are not different, suggesting that vertical velocity PDFs are a poor predictor for explaining the microphysical variability in cirrus. Instead, cirrus microphysical contrasts may be driven by differences in ice supersaturations or aerosols.},

  abstract = {The role of turbulence in droplet growth in clouds is controversial, in part because of the difficulty of studying underlying processes in the cloud environment, and in part because of the difficulty of achieving real cloud conditions in controlled laboratory or computational studies. This paper is a synthesis of research on turbulence effects on cloud droplets that includes field and laboratory studies. Results from cloud measurements show that the turbulence exhibits similar internal intermittency to that observed in the laboratory, and in direct numerical simulations. We explore the consequences of this by relating measurements of droplet accelerations in the laboratory, to conditions observed in the clouds. We show that there is a strong likelihood of droplet accelerations in clouds exceeding the acceleration due to gravity. We discuss these observations in terms of the dynamics of droplets, including velocity statistics and clustering, and their influence on droplet growth.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Coincident profiling observations from Doppler lidars and radars are used to estimate the turbulence energy dissipation rate (ε) using three different data sources: (i) Doppler radar velocity (DRV), (ii) Doppler lidar velocity (DLV), and (iii) Doppler radar spectrum width (DRW) measurements. The agreement between the derived ε estimates is examined at the cloud base height of stratiform warm clouds. Collocated ε estimates based on power spectra analysis of DRV and DLV measurements show good agreement (correlation coefficient of 0.86 and 0.78 for both cases analyzed here) during both drizzling and nondrizzling conditions. This suggests that unified (below and above cloud base) time-height estimates of ε in cloud-topped boundary layer conditions can be produced. This also suggests that eddy dissipation rate can be estimated throughout the cloud layer without the constraint that clouds need to be nonprecipitating. Eddy dissipation rate estimates based on DRW measurements compare well with the estimates based on Doppler velocity but their performance deteriorates as precipitation size particles are introduced in the radar volume and broaden the DRW values. Based on this finding, a methodology to estimate the Doppler spectra broadening due to the spread of the drop size distribution is presented. The uncertainties in ε introduced by signal-to-noise conditions, the estimation of the horizontal wind, the selection of the averaging time window, and the presence of precipitation are discussed in detail.},

  abstract  = {The impact of assumed ice crystal morphology on thermal infrared (IR) radiative properties of subtropical cirrus is quantified. In particular, the crystal-shape-dependent profiles of downwelling and upwelling thermal IR (broadband and spectral) irradiances and the radiative forcing of cirrus (at the top and bottom of the atmosphere) are investigated. For this purpose, airborne measurements of ice crystal size distribution (in terms of ice crystal maximum dimension) from the CRYSTAL-FACE campaign and a recently published library of thermal IR optical properties of nonspherical ice crystal habits are implemented into radiative transfer simulations. Two cirrus cases are studied in detail: (1) a high (cold) cirrus with small optical thickness (≈1 at 10.8 μm wavelength) and (2) a lower (warmer) cirrus of relatively large optical thickness (≈7). The relative effects of ice crystal shape on thermal IR irradiance are substantial for the high, optically thin cirrus (up to 70\%). Spectrally, the largest effects of ice crystal shape are identified in the atmospheric window spanning from 8 to 12 μm wavelengths, especially for the upwelling irradiance above the cirrus. For the low cirrus of large optical thickness the thermal IR irradiance is only slightly sensitive to ice crystal habit (less than 15–20\%). Within the major gas absorption bands the thermal IR radiation is essentially insensitive to ice crystal shape. Furthermore, it is concluded that the thermal IR radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere contains significant ice crystal shape dependence for the high cirrus case.},

  abstract  = {We diagnose climate feedback parameters and CO2 forcing including rapid adjustment in twelve atmosphere/mixed-layer-ocean (``slab'') climate models from the CMIP3/CFMIP-1 project (the AR4 ensemble) and fifteen parameter-perturbed versions of the HadSM3 slab model (the PPE). In both ensembles, differences in climate feedbacks can account for approximately twice as much of the range in climate sensitivity as differences in CO2 forcing. In the AR4 ensemble, cloud effects can explain the full range of climate sensitivities, and cloud feedback components contribute four times as much as cloud components of CO2 forcing to the range. Non-cloud feedbacks are required to fully account for the high sensitivities of some models however. The largest contribution to the high sensitivity of HadGEM1 is from a high latitude clear-sky shortwave feedback, and clear-sky longwave feedbacks contribute substantially to the highest sensitivity members of the PPE. Differences in low latitude ocean regions (30{\textdegree}N/S) contribute more to the range than those in mid-latitude oceans (30--55{\textdegree}N/S), low/mid latitude land (55{\textdegree}N/S) or high latitude ocean/land (55--90{\textdegree}N/S), but contributions from these other regions are required to account fully for the higher model sensitivities, for example from land areas in IPSL CM4. Net cloud feedback components over the low latitude oceans sorted into percentile ranges of lower tropospheric stability (LTS) show largest differences among models in stable regions, mainly due to their shortwave components, most of which are positive in spite of increasing LTS. Differences in the mid-stability range are smaller, but cover a larger area, contributing a comparable amount to the range in climate sensitivity. These are strongly anti-correlated with changes in subsidence. Cloud components of CO2 forcing also show the largest differences in stable regions, and are strongly anticorrelated with changes in estimated inversion strength (EIS). This is qualitatively consistent with what would be expected from observed relationships between EIS and low-level cloud fraction. We identify a number of cases where individual models show unusually strong forcings and feedbacks compared to other members of the ensemble. We encourage modelling groups to investigate unusual model behaviours further with sensitivity experiments. Most of the models fail to correctly reproduce the observed relationships between stability and cloud radiative effect in the subtropics, indicating that there remains considerable room for model improvements in the future.},

  abstract  = {Using a 2-year data set of combined lidar and cloud radar measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and CloudSat satellites, the occurrence of tropical cirrus and deep convective clouds is studied. The cloud identification algorithm takes advantage of the ability of the radar to probe deep precipitating clouds and of the lidar to sample even subvisual cirrus clouds. Examined are the frequency of occurrence and the geographical distribution of these clouds, and their apparent interconnections. There is a strong apparent diurnal variability in tropical cirrus mainly over land, with significantly more cirrus detected at night compared to day, but no clear diurnal pattern in deep convective activity. CALIPSO daylight signal noise effects do not appear to be not responsible for the diurnal cirrus pattern, because high, thin tropopause transitional layer (TTL) cirrus do not show a clear diurnal effect. Stratifying the global results by estimated visible cloud optical depth τ, we find that most of the planet's subvisual (τ < ∼0.03) cirrus clouds occur in the tropics and are more frequent at night and over ocean; thin (∼0.03 < τ < ∼0.3) cirrus have their highest global frequencies over equatorial landmasses and in the west Pacific region, and are also more frequent at night but occur mainly over land; and opaque (∼0.3 < τ < ∼3.0) cirrus are spread globally and tend to occur during the day over ocean. Although it is unknown which of the several proposed cirrus cloud formation mechanisms are key in the tropics, the close association of cirrus with convective clouds implies that tropical cirrus are linked to deep convective activity, with the likely exception of TTL cirrus clouds.},

  abstract  = {The goal of this chapter is to synthesize information about what is now known about one of the three main types of clouds, cirrus, and to identify areas where more knowledge is needed. Cirrus clouds, composed of ice particles, form in the upper troposphere, where temperatures are generally below −30°C. Satellite observations show that the maximum-occurrence frequency of cirrus is near the tropics, with a large latitudinal movement seasonally. In situ measurements obtained over a wide range of cirrus types, formation mechanisms, temperatures, and geographical locations indicate that the ice water content and particle size generally decrease with decreasing temperature, whereas the ice particle concentration is nearly constant or increases slightly with decreasing temperature. High ice concentrations, sometimes observed in strong updrafts, result from homogeneous nucleation. The satellite-based and in situ measurements indicate that cirrus ice crystals typically differ from the simple, idealized geometry for smooth hexagonal shapes, indicating complexity and/or surface roughness. Their shapes significantly impact cirrus radiative properties and feedbacks to climate. Cirrus clouds, one of the most uncertain components of general circulation models (GCM), pose one of the greatest challenges in predicting the rate and geographical pattern of climate change. Improved measurements of the properties and size distributions and surface structure of small ice crystals (about 20 μm) and identifying the dominant ice nucleation process (heterogeneous versus homogeneous ice nucleation) under different cloud dynamical forcings will lead to a better representation of their properties in GCM and in modeling their current and future effects on climate.},

This review assesses recent observational and modeling evidence of how anthropogenic activities might affect cirrus. Changes in physical properties and chemical composition of liquid aerosol particles will unlikely affect cirrus significantly, but anthropogenic influences may occur through changes in heterogeneous ice nuclei. Two main uncertain factors contribute to the current inability to constrain background cirrus formation: small-scale variability in dynamical forcings that drive ice nucleation parameterizations and the ability of airborne particles to act as efficient heterogeneous ice nuclei. These uncertainties keep us from drawing robust conclusions about anthropogenic influences on cirrus. Microphysical and macrophysical representation of cirrus in global models must first be advanced before we can predict changes in climate with fewer uncertainties. Some climate intervention studies suggest a potential cooling effect of deliberately perturbed cirrus, but at the risk of modifying precipitation inadvertently.},

Direct observations of cirrus properties and their variability are still incomplete, currently limiting our understanding of the clouds’ impact on climate. Also, dynamical effects on clouds and feedbacks are not adequately represented in today’s weather prediction models.Here, we present the rationale, objectives, and selected scientific highlights of ML-CIRRUS using the G-550 aircraft of the German atmospheric science community. The first combined in situ–remote sensing cloud mission with HALO united state-of-the-art cloud probes, a lidar and novel ice residual, aerosol, trace gas, and radiation instrumentation. The aircraft observations were accompanied by remote sensing from satellite and ground and by numerical simulations.In spring 2014, HALO performed 16 flights above Europe with a focus on anthropogenic contrail cirrus and midlatitude cirrus induced by frontal systems including warm conveyor belts and other dynamical regimes (jet streams, mountain waves, and convection). Highlights from ML-CIRRUS include 1) new observations of microphysical and radiative cirrus properties and their variability in meteorological regimes typical for midlatitudes, 2) insights into occurrence of in situ–formed and lifted liquid-origin cirrus, 3) validation of cloud forecasts and satellite products, 4) assessment of contrail predictability, and 5) direct observations of contrail cirrus and their distinction from natural cirrus. Hence, ML-CIRRUS provides a comprehensive dataset on cirrus in the densely populated European midlatitudes with the scope to enhance our understanding of cirrus clouds and their role for climate and weather.},

  abstract  = {The probability of occurrence of ice crystal number densities in young cirrus clouds is examined based on airborne measurements. The observations have been carried out at midlatitudes in both hemispheres at equivalent latitudes (52-55°N/S) during the same season (local autumn in 2000). The in situ measurements considered in the present study include temperatures, vertical velocities, and total ice crystal concentrations, the latter determined with high precision and accuracy using a counterflow virtual impactor. Most young cirrus clouds typically contain high number densities (1-10 cm-3) of small (diameter <20 mm) ice crystals. This mode dominates the probability distributions and is shown to be caused by rapid cooling rates associated with updraft speeds in the range 10-100 cm s-1. A second mode containing larger crystals extends from ~1 cm-3 to low concentrations close to the detection threshold (~3 x 10-4 cm-3) and could be associated with lower updraft speeds. Results of a statistical analysis provide compelling evidence that the dynamical variability of vertical air motions on the mesoscale is the key factor determining the observed probability distributions of pristine ice crystal concentrations in cirrus. Other factors considered are changes of temperature as well as size, number, and ice nucleation thresholds of the freezing aerosol particles. The variability in vertical velocities is caused by atmospheric gravity waves leading to small-scale temperature fluctuations. Inasmuch as gravity waves are widespread, mesoscale variability in vertical velocities can be viewed as a universal feature of young cirrus clouds. Large-scale models that do not account for this subgrid-scale variability yield erroneous predictions of the variability of basic cirrus cloud properties. Climate change may bring about changes in the global distribution of updraft speeds, mean air temperatures, and aerosol properties. As shown in this work, these changes could significantly modify the probability distribution of cirrus ice crystal concentrations. This study emphasizes the key role of vertical velocities and mesoscale variability in vertical velocities in controlling cirrus properties. The results suggest that, in any effort to ascribe cause to trends of cirrus cloud properties, a careful evaluation of dynamical changes in cloud formation should be done before conclusions regarding the role of other anthropogenic factors, such as changes in aerosol composition, are made.},

Similar results are obtained from CALIOP and the ground-based lidar, with a mean difference in occurrence of ~5% between both instruments. From the ground-based lidar data, a slight decrease in occurrence of ~3% per decade is observed but found statistically insignificant. Based on a clustering analysis of cirrus cloud parameters, three distinct classes have been identified and investigations concerning their origin are discussed. Properties of these different classes are analysed, showing that thin cirrus in the upper troposphere represent ~50% of cloud cover detected in summer and fall, decreasing by 15–20% for other seasons.},

  abstract = {Profiles of in situ measurements of ice crystal size distribution of subtropical cirrus were used to calculate solar spectral irradiances above and below the clouds. Spheres and nonspherical ice crystal habits (columns, hollows, plates, bullets, and aggregates) were assumed in the calculations. The simulation results were compared to irradiance measurements from the NASA Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer. The microphysical and radiation data were collected by three aircraft during CRYSTAL-FACE. Two cirrus cases (optical thickness of about 1 and 7) from two mission dates (26 and 23 July 2002) were investigated in detail. The measured downwelling and upwelling irradiance spectra above the cirrus could mostly be reproduced by the radiation model to within ±5–10\% for most ice crystal habits. Below the cirrus the simulations disagreed with the measured irradiances due to surface albedo variability along the flight track, and nonoptimal colocation between the microphysical and irradiance measurements. The impact of shape characteristics of the crystals was important for the reflected irradiances above the optically thin cirrus, especially for small solar zenith angles, because in this case single-scattering dominated the solar radiation field. For the cirrus of moderate optical thickness the enhanced multiple scattering tended to diminish particular shape features caused by nonspherical single-scattering. Within the ice absorption bands the shape-related differences in the absorption characteristics of the individual nonspherical ice crystals were amplified if multiple scattering prevailed. Furthermore, it was found that below the cloud the shape sensitivity of the downwelling irradiance spectra is larger compared to the nonsphericity effects on reflected irradiances above the cirrus. Finally, it was shown that the calculated cirrus solar radiative forcing could vary by as much as 26\% depending on the ice crystal habit.},

  abstract  = {Doppler radar measurements at different frequencies (50 and 2835 MHz) are used to characterize the terminal fall speed of hydrometeors and the vertical air motion in tropical ice clouds and to evaluate statistical methods for retrieving these two parameters using a single vertically pointing cloud radar. For the observed vertical air motions, it is found that the mean vertical air velocity in ice clouds is small on average, as is assumed in terminal fall speed retrieval methods. The mean vertical air motions are slightly negative (downdraft) between the melting layer (5-km height) and 6.3-km height, and positive (updraft) above this altitude, with two peaks of 6 and 7 cm s−1 at 7.7- and 9.7-km height. For the retrieved hydrometeor terminal fall speeds, it is found that the variability of terminal fall speeds within narrow reflectivity ranges is typically within the acceptable uncertainties for using terminal fall speeds in ice cloud microphysical retrievals. This study also evaluates the performance of previously published statistical methods of separating terminal fall speed and vertical air velocity from vertically pointing Doppler radar measurements using the 50-/2835-MHz radar retrievals as a reference. It is found that the variability of the terminal fall speed–radar reflectivity relationship (Vt–Ze) is large in ice clouds and cannot be parameterized accurately with a single relationship. A well-defined linear relationship is found between the two coefficients of a power-law Vt–Ze relationship, but a more accurate microphysical retrieval is obtained using Doppler velocity measurements to better constrain the Vt–Ze relationship for each cloud. When comparing the different statistical methods to the reference, the distribution of terminal fall speed residual is wide, with most residuals being in the ±30–40 cm s−1 range about the mean. The typical mean residual ranged from 15 to 20 cm s−1, with different methods having mean residuals of <10 cm s−1 at some heights, but not at the same heights for all methods. The so-called Vt–Ze technique was the most accurate above 9-km height, and the running-mean technique outperformed the other techniques below 9-km height. Sensitivity tests of the running-mean technique indicate that the 20-min average is the best trade-off for the type of ice clouds considered in this analysis. A new technique is proposed that incorporates simple averages of Doppler velocity for each (Ze, H) couple in a given cloud. This technique, referred to as DOP–Ze–H, was found to outperform the three other methods at most heights, with a mean terminal fall residual of <10 cm s−1 at all heights. This error magnitude is compatible with the use of such retrieved terminal fall speeds for the retrieval of microphysical properties.},

On the subject of lightscattering simulations, several classical computational approaches are reviewed, including the conventional geometric-opticsmethod and its improved forms, the finite-difference time domain technique, the pseudo-spectral time domain technique, thediscrete dipole approximation method, and theTTT-matrix method, with specific applications to the computation of the single-scattering properties of individual ice crystals.  The strengths and weaknesses associated with each approach are discussed.With reference to remote sensing, operational retrieval algorithms are reviewed for retrieving cloud optical depth and effectiveparticle size based on solar or thermal infrared (IR) bands.  To illustrate the performance of the current solar- and IR-basedretrievals, two case studies are presented based on spaceborne observations.  The need for a more realistic ice cloud opticalmodel to obtain spectrally consistent retrievals is demonstrated. Furthermore, to complement ice cloud property studies basedon passive radiometric measurements, the advantage of incorporating lidar and/or polarimetric measurements is discussed.The  performance  of  ice  cloud  models  based  on  the  use  of  different  ice  habits  to  represent  ice  particles  is  illustrated  bycomparing model results with satellite observations.  A summary is provided of a number of parameterization schemes forice cloud radiative properties that were developed for application to broadband radiative transfer submodels within generalcirculation models (GCMs). The availability of the single-scattering properties of complex ice habits has led to more accurateradiation parameterizations.

We study responses of cirrus clouds to simplified global seeding strategies in terms of their radiative fluxes with the help of the ECHAM‐HAM general circulation model. Our cirrus scheme takes into account the competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing, preexisting ice crystals, and the full spectrum of updraft velocities. While we find that the cirrus cloud radiative effect evaluated from our model is positive and large enough (5.7 W/m2) to confirm their geoengineering potential, none of the seeding strategies achieves a significant cooling due to complex microphysical mechanisms limiting their climatic responses. After globally uniform seeding is applied, we observe an increase in cirrus cloud cover, a decrease in ice crystal number concentration, and a decrease in ice crystal radius. An analysis of their respective radiative contributions points to the ice crystal radius decrease as the main factor limiting seeding effectiveness.},

The largest “annual” mean (approximated by averaging the results of four particular days, one from each season) changes of the global top-of-atmosphere and surface shortwave radiative fluxes are produced by stratocumulus, altostratus, and cirrostratus clouds (i.e., clouds with moderate optical thicknesses).

Multiple linear regression is used to relate the radiation budget data to the cloud data. Comparing cloud forcing estimates obtained from the ISCCP-ERBE regression with those derived from the ERBE scene identification shows generally good agreement except over snow, in tropical convective regions, and in regions that are either nearly cloudless or always overcast. It is suggested that a substantial fraction of the disagreement in longwave cloud forcing in tropical convective regions is associated with the fact that the ERBE scene identification does not take into account variations in upper-tropospheric water vapor. On a global average basis, low clouds make the largest contribution to the net energy balance of the earth, because they cover such a large area and because their albedo effect dominates their effect on emitted thermal radiation. High, optically thick clouds can also very effectively reduce the energy balance, however, because their very high albedos overcome their low emission temperatures.},

  abstract  = {A small subset of the atmospheric aerosol population has the ability to induce ice formation at conditions under which ice would not form without them (heterogeneous ice nucleation). While no closed theoretical description of this process and the requirements for good ice nuclei is available, numerous studies have attempted to quantify the ice nucleation ability of different particles empirically in laboratory experiments. In this article, an overview of these results is provided. Ice nucleation "onset" conditions for various mineral dust, soot, biological, organic and ammonium sulfate particles are summarized. Typical temperature-supersaturation regions can be identified for the "onset" of ice nucleation of these different particle types, but the various particle sizes and activated fractions reported in different studies have to be taken into account when comparing results obtained with different methodologies. When intercomparing only data obtained under the same conditions, it is found that dust mineralogy is not a consistent predictor of higher or lower ice nucleation ability. However, the broad majority of studies agrees on a reduction of deposition nucleation by various coatings on mineral dust. The ice nucleation active surface site (INAS) density is discussed as a simple and empirical normalized measure for ice nucleation activity. For most immersion and condensation freezing measurements on mineral dust, estimates of the temperature-dependent INAS density agree within about two orders of magnitude. For deposition nucleation on dust, the spread is significantly larger, but a general trend of increasing INAS densities with increasing supersaturation is found. For soot, the presently available results are divergent. Estimated average INAS densities are high for ice-nucleation active bacteria at high subzero temperatures. At the same time, it is shown that INAS densities of some other biological aerosols, like certain pollen grains, fungal spores and diatoms, tend to be similar to those of dust. These particles may owe their high ice nucleation onsets to their large sizes. Surface-area-dependent parameterizations of heterogeneous ice nucleation are discussed. For immersion freezing on mineral dust, fitted INAS densities are available, but should not be used outside the temperature interval of the data they were based on. Classical nucleation theory, if employed with only one fitted contact angle, does not reproduce the observed temperature dependence for immersion nucleation, the temperature and supersaturation dependence for deposition nucleation, and the time dependence of ice nucleation. Formulations of classical nucleation theory with distributions of contact angles offer possibilities to overcome these weaknesses.},

Currently, the AIRTOSS isinstrumented with a Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP) for measuring cloud microphysical properties and an Inertial NavigationSystem (INS) for measurements of flight attitudes. The cabledragging AIRTOSS can be as long as four kilometres. Thus, truly collocated measurements in two altitudes above, in, andbelow clouds can be obtained.  Results from first test flightswith  Learjet  and  AIRTOSS  are  reported  here.   The  flights were performed from Hohn Airport, Germany.  Specific ma-noeuvres were flown to test the aerodynamic behaviour of the drag-body and to investigate the suitability of AIRTOSS for high-precision irradiance measurements which require a stable flight attitude of AIRTOSS. The flight attitude data show that AIRTOSS is sensitive to several flight manoeuvres such as turns, altitude and airspeed changes, and also to changes of towing cable length.  The effects of these manoeuvres on the attitude angles of AIRTOSS have been quantified. Maximum roll angle deviations were observed during turns. Even small changes in heading can lead to high roll angles (one degree change in heading causes a change in roll angle of about  eight  degrees).   The  pitch  angle  varies  during  climb or dive periods, extending or retracting of towing cable, acceleration or deceleration, and even when flying at too low or too high true airspeed depending on altitude.   Values of pitch angle between −5 degree (dive) and 8 degree (climb and retracting towing cable) have been observed.  While change in attitude is not problematic for cloud particle property measurements it is for radiation measurements.   Here,  the deviation from the horizontal should be no more than 3 degree to avoid large errors.  When keeping the above mentioned flight parameters constant,  sufficiently  stable  flight  conditions  can  be  maintained to perform high-quality irradiance measurements with AIRTOSS in future experiments.  During this test campaign also observations of cloud microphysical data as for example droplet number concentrations and size distributions with the AIRTOSS in stratocumulus clouds were performed to prove the compliance with scientific needs.  Simultaneous spectral cloud  radiation  measurements  have  been  made.   The  measurements of internal operational data of AIRTOSS as wel las  the  first  atmospheric  data  demonstrate  the  suitability  of this tandem platform for detailed cloud microphysics and radiation interaction studies.},

  abstract  = {CloudSat is a satellite experiment designed to measure the vertical structure of clouds from space. The expected launch of CloudSat is planned for 2004, and once launched, CloudSat will orbit in formation as part of a constellation of satellites (the A-Train) that includes NASA's Aqua and Aura satellites, a NASA–CNES lidar satellite (CALIPSO), and a CNES satellite carrying a polarimeter (PARASOL). A unique feature that CloudSat brings to this constellation is the ability to fly a precise orbit enabling the fields of view of the CloudSat radar to be overlapped with the CALIPSO lidar footprint and the other measurements of the constellation. The precision and near simultaneity of this overlap creates a unique multisatellite observing system for studying the atmospheric processes essential to the hydrological cycle.

The vertical profiles of cloud properties provided by CloudSat on the global scale fill a critical gap in the investigation of feedback mechanisms linking clouds to climate. Measuring these profiles requires a combination of active and passive instruments, and this will be achieved by combining the radar data of CloudSat with data from other active and passive sensors of the constellation. This paper describes the underpinning science and general overview of the mission, provides some idea of the expected products and anticipated application of these products, and the potential capability of the A-Train for cloud observations. Notably, the CloudSat mission is expected to stimulate new areas of research on clouds. The mission also provides an important opportunity to demonstrate active sensor technology for future scientific and tactical applications. The CloudSat mission is a partnership between NASA's JPL, the Canadian Space Agency, Colorado State University, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Department of Energy.},

  abstract  = {In recent measurements, liquid water was not detected in cirrus clouds below −40°C and, since there appear to be few ice-forming nuclei in the upper troposphere, ice nucleation evidently takes place by homogeneous freezing of solution droplets. A numerical model consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations is used to study this process in a rising parcel containing a distribution of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The model traces the evolution of both the particle population (liquid and solid phase) and the thermodynamic variables in the parcel. Droplet growth rates are calculated in 20 size categories assuming ammonium sulfate nuclei; CCN distributions are taken from aircraft data. Homogeneous nucleation rates are derived by classical methods; adjustments for solution effects are made by considering the water vapor pressure over droplet surface.

Results for convective cirrus simulations indicate that if homogeneous freezing is not considered, liquid water should be detected below −40°C; if homogeneous freezing is considered, the rapid growth of ice crystals and concurrent vapor depletion prevent water saturation from being reached. All droplets forming on a given mass CCN freeze almost simultaneously; the homogeneous freezing of most of the entire droplet distribution takes place over a temperature range of less than 1°C. The likelihood of a droplet being frozen is increased by lower temperatures, larger droplet diameter, or lower solution density. Most of the ice crystals produced originate from droplets containing CCN of mass 10−13 to 10−15 g; the number of ice crystals eventually produced is a function of the temperature, the vertical air velocity, and the CCN distribution.},

This variability attribution can be done at various spatial and temporal resolutions with metrics derived from online adjoint sensitivities of droplet and crystal number to relevant inputs. Such metrics are defined and calculated from simulations using the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model Version 5.1 (CAM5.1). Input updraft velocity fluctuations can explain as much as 48\% of temporal variability in output ice crystal number and 61\% in droplet number in GEOS-5 and up to 89\% of temporal variability in output ice crystal number in CAM5.1. In both models, this vertical velocity attribution depends strongly on altitude. Despite its importance for hydrometeor formation, simulated vertical velocity distributions are rarely evaluated against observations due to the sparsity of relevant data. Coordinated effort by the atmospheric community to develop more consistent, observationally based updraft treatments will help to close this knowledge gap.},

To this end, sensitivities of Ni to input variables like aerosol number and diameter provide valuable information about nucleation regime and efficiency for a given model formulation. Here we use the adjoint model of the adjoint of a cirrus formation parameterization (Barahona and Nenes, 2009b) to understand Ni variability for various ice-nucleating particle (INP) spectra. Inputs are generated with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5, and simulations are done with a theoretically derived spectrum, an empirical lab-based spectrum and two field-based empirical spectra that differ in the nucleation threshold for black carbon particles and in the active site density for dust. The magnitude and sign of Ni sensitivity to insoluble aerosol number can be directly linked to nucleation regime and efficiency of various INP. The lab-based spectrum calculates much higher INP efficiencies than field-based ones, which reveals a disparity in aerosol surface properties. Ni sensitivity to temperature tends to be low, due to the compensating effects of temperature on INP spectrum parameters; this low temperature sensitivity regime has been experimentally reported before but never deconstructed as done here.},

an optimally beam-matched radar–radiometer; a vertical resolution of up to 5 m with sensitivities down
to 262 dBZ at 100-m distance; adjustable measurement configurations within the vertical column to account
for different observational requirements; an automatic regulation of the transmitter power to avoid receiver
saturation; and a high-powered blowing system that prevents hydrometeors from adhering to the radome.
JOYRAD-94 has been calibrated with an uncertainty of 0.5 dB that was assessed by observing a metal sphere
in the radar’s far field and by comparing radar reflectivities to a collocated 35-GHz radar. The calibrations of
the radar receiver and the radiometric receiver are performed via a two-point calibration with liquid nitrogen.
The passive channel at 89 GHz is particularly useful for deriving an estimate of the liquid water path (LWP).
The developed retrieval shows that the LWP can be retrieved with an RMS uncertainty (not including potential
calibration offsets) of about 615 g m22 when constraining the integrated water vapor from an external source with
an uncertainty of 62 kg m22. Finally, a dealiasing method [dual-radar dealiasing method (DRDM)] for FMCW
Doppler spectra is introduced that combines measurements of two collocated radars with different measurement
setups. The DRDM ensures high range resolution with a wide unambiguous Doppler velocity range.},

However, polar LBCs are commonly initiated under stable, nonturbulent conditions. Using long term data from the North Slope of Alaska and McMurdo, Antarctica, we show that nonturbulent conditions prevail in ~25% of detected LBCs, surmised to be preferentially early in their lifecycle. We conclude that nonturbulent LBCs are likely common over the polar regions owing primarily to atmospheric temperature and stability. Such stable environments are known to support gravity wave activity. Using large eddy simulations, we find that short to intermediate period gravity waves may catalyze turbulence formation when aerosol particles available for activation are sufficiently small. We posit that the frequent occurrence of nonturbulent LBCs over the polar regions has implications for polar aerosol cloud interactions and their parameterization in large scale models.},

  abstract  = {Since high and low clouds ubiquitously overlie the Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) region, the cloud radiative effect (CRE) cannot be influenced by either high or low clouds, but by combinations of the clouds. This study investigates the CRE of multi-layered clouds in TWP via a radiative transfer model, Streamer. We assumed that multi-layered clouds are composed of full coverage of high clouds overlying low clouds with fractional coverage. The simulation results show that low clouds readily change CREs from positive to negative in the case of optically thin high clouds, even if the fraction of low clouds takes 10% of that of high clouds. Also, various combinations of physical properties of multi-layered high and low clouds allow more CRE variability (− 253.76 to 93.10 W m−2) than single-layered clouds do (− 101.62 to 96.95 W m−2). Even in the same conditions (total column cloud optical thickness = 15 and high cloud top pressure = 200 hPa), the multi-layer clouds have various CREs from − 180.55 to 45.64 W m−2, while the single-layer high clouds − 2.00 W m−2. These findings are also comparable with satellite observations from CERES and CALIPSO. The present study suggests that considerable uncertainty of radiative effects of high clouds over TWP can attribute to low clouds below high clouds.},

  abstract = {{Retrieval datasets are prevalent and understanding the different sources of uncertainties in these datasets is critical to properly interpret and use these data.Remote sensing instruments are heavily used to provide observations for both the operational and research communities. These sensors do not provide direct observations of the desired atmospheric variables, but instead, retrieval algorithms are necessary to convert the indirect observations into the variable of interest. It is critical to be aware of the underlying assumptions made by many retrieval algorithms, including that the retrieval problem is often ill-posed and that there are various sources of uncertainty that need to be treated properly. In short, the retrieval challenge is to invert a set of noisy observations to obtain estimates of atmospheric quantities. The problem is often complicated by imperfect forward models, imperfect prior knowledge, and by the existence of nonunique solutions. Optimal Estimation (OE) is a widely used physical retrieval method that combines measurements, prior information, and the corresponding uncertainties based on Bayes’ theorem to find an optimal solution for the atmospheric state. Furthermore, OE also allows the relative contributions of the different sources of error to the uncertainty in the final retrieved atmospheric state to be understood.Here, we provide a novel Python library to illustrate the use of OE for inverse problems in Atmospheric Sciences. We introduce two example problems: How to retrieve drop size distribution parameters from radar observations and how to retrieve the temperature profile from ground-based microwave sensors. Using these examples, we discuss common pitfalls, how the various error sources impact the retrieval and how the quality of the retrieval results can be quantified.}},

In this study, we use a two‐months X, Ka, W‐Band Doppler radar dataset of mid‐latitude winter clouds to infer statistical growth signatures of ice and snow particles. The observational statistics are compared to forward simulated radar moments based on simulations of the campaign time period with a high‐resolution version of the ICON model and a two‐moment microphysical scheme. The statistical comparison shows very good agreement of the simulated vertical structure of radar reflectivity and surface precipitation rate. The dual‐wavelength ratios, which are closely related to the mean particle size, also show consistently a major increase at temperatures larger than ‐15○C. However, at temperatures larger than ‐7○C, ICON increasingly overestimates the mean particle size. The statistics of mean Doppler velocities also reveals that the model overestimates the terminal velocity of snow particles, especially at larger sizes. We discuss possible reasons for the identified discrepancies, such as an unrealistic temperature dependence of the sticking efficiency or the non‐saturation of terminal velocities at larger sizes caused by the implemented power‐law relations. Our study exemplary demonstrates the importance of combining various radar techniques for identifying issues in simulated microphysical processes, which can otherwise be hidden due to compensating errors.},

The method is applicable to uniform, stratified clouds and is applied here to cirrus clouds. A unique aspect of the technique consists of partitioning the Doppler velocities into discrete cloud height and cloud reflectivity bins prior to temporal averaging. The first step of the method is to temporally average the partitioned Doppler velocities over an hour or two to remove the effects of small-scale vertical air motions. This establishes relationships between particle fall velocity and radar reflectivity at various levels within the cloud. Comparisons with aircraft in situ observations from other experiments show consistency with the remote-sensing observations. These results suggest that particle fall speeds can be determined to within 5–10 cm s−1 by means of this technique.},

  abstract = {Cirrus clouds composed of small ice crystals are often the first solid matter encountered by sunlight as it streams into Earth’s atmosphere. A broad array of recent research has emphasized that photon-particle scattering calculations are very sensitive to ice particle morphology, complexity, and surface roughness. Uncertain variations in these parameters have major implications for successfully parameterizing the radiative ramifications of cirrus clouds in climate models. To date, characterization of the microscale details of cirrus particle morphology has been limited by the particles’ inaccessibility and technical difficulty in capturing imagery with sufficient resolution. Results from a new experimental system achieve much higher resolution images of cirrus ice particles than existing airborne particle imaging systems. The novel system (Ice Cryo-Encapsulation by Balloon, ICE-Ball) employs a balloon-borne payload with environmental sensors and hermetically-sealed cryo-encapsulation cells. The payload captures ice particles from cirrus clouds, seals them, and returns them via parachute for vapor-locked transfer onto a cryo-scanning electron microscopy stage (cryo-SEM). From 2016–2019, the ICE-Ball system has successfully yielded high resolution particle images on nine cirrus-penetrating flights. On several flights, including one highlighted here in detail, thousands of cirrus particles were retrieved and imaged, revealing unanticipated particle morphologies, extensive habit heterogeneity, multiple scales of mesoscale roughening, a wide array of embedded aerosol particles, and even greater complexity than expected.},

  abstract  = {While meteorologists can obtain much useful information by using radar in a qualitative manner, great benefit can be derived by obtaining quantitative measurements. However, these measurements have been found, in general, to be below values calculated from radar theory by a factor of between two and five, and there has been no satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy. In this paper, the radar equation for a meteorological target is derived, particular attention being devoted to the effect of the shape of the main lobe of the beam, and of the radiation outside it. It is shown that previous theoretical expressions for both the gain and the echoing volume have been too large, and hence that previous equations overestimated the received power. The present equation gives good agreement with all the experimental data.},

  abstract  = {A method for the parameterization of ice-phase microphysics is proposed and used to develop a new bulk microphysics scheme. All ice-phase particles are represented by several physical properties that evolve freely in time and space. The scheme prognoses four ice mixing ratio variables, total mass, rime mass, rime volume, and number, allowing 4 degrees of freedom for representing the particle properties using a single category. This approach represents a significant departure from traditional microphysics schemes in which ice-phase hydrometeors are partitioned into various predefined categories (e.g., cloud ice, snow, and graupel) with prescribed characteristics. The liquid-phase component of the new scheme uses a standard two-moment, two-category approach.

The proposed method and a complete description of the new predicted particle properties (P3) scheme are provided. Results from idealized model simulations of a two-dimensional squall line are presented that illustrate overall behavior of the scheme. Despite its use of a single ice-phase category, the scheme simulates a realistically wide range of particle characteristics in different regions of the squall line, consistent with observed ice particles in real squall lines. Sensitivity tests show that both the prediction of the rime mass fraction and the rime density are important for the simulation of the squall-line structure and precipitation.},

  abstract = {Abstract A retrieval for characteristic raindrop size and width of the drop size distribution (DSD) based on triple-frequency vertical Doppler radar measurements is developed. The algorithm exploits a statistical relation that maps measurements of the differential Doppler velocities at X and Ka and at Ka and W bands into the two aforementioned DSD moments. The statistical mapping has been founded on 7,900 hr of disdrometer-observed DSDs and their simulated Doppler velocities. Additionally, a retrieval of based only on measurements is also presented, and its performance is compared to the analogous algorithm exploiting data. The retrievals are tested using triple-frequency radar data collected during a recent field campaign held at the Juelich Observatory for Cloud Evolution (JOYCE, Germany) where in situ measurements of the DSD were carried out only few meters away from the vertically pointing radars. The triple-frequency retrieval is able to obtain with an uncertainty below 25\% for ranging from 0.7 to 2.4 mm. Compared to previously published dual-frequency retrievals, the third frequency does not improve the retrieval for small (  mm). However, it significantly surpasses the algorithm for larger (20\% versus 50\% bias at 2.25 mm). Also compared to method, the triple-frequency retrieval is found to provide an improvement of 15\% in terms of bias for  mm. The triple-frequency retrieval of performs with an uncertainty of 20–50\% for  mm, with the best performance for  mm.},
